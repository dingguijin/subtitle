1
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:09,775
- There's a time when the
operation of the machine

2
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:12,011
becomes so odious,

3
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:15,481
makes you so sick at heart
that you can't take part.

4
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,783
You can't even
passively take part,

5
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:20,285
and you've got to put
your bodies upon the gears

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,688
and upon the wheels,
upon the levers,

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,089
upon all the apparatus,

8
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,791
and you've got to make it stop!

9
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:32,498
♪

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,134
- First, let me start by
saying Mario Savio's

11
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,036
"Operation of the Machine"

12
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:40,039
is one of my favorite
speeches of all time.

13
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:44,043
Mario wasn't a politician
or some famous Hollywood star.

14
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:47,212
He was just a student
who was for civil rights.

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,081
He stood on a car at Berkley

16
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,083
and screamed whatever
came into his head.

17
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:53,218
He didn't care that he had
a stuttering problem

18
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,088
or that he might get thrown
out of school, which he did.

19
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,324
He just wanted
his voice to be heard

20
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:03,796
and be unencumbered
by the machine.

21
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,431
As an investigative
writer that has yet

22
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,801
to be officially published,

23
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,804
I can relate to Mario's desire.

24
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:22,114
That's me behind the wheel,

25
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:26,718
Jay Bahadur, proud college
graduate of the class of 2007,

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,654
arguably the worst year

27
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:30,556
since the Great Depression
to graduate school,

28
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:33,425
but timing was
never my strength.

29
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:43,569
In fact, good timing seems to be
at odds with my very existence,

30
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:46,738
but like many
unpleasantries in life,

31
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,408
you just learn to deal with it.

32
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,329
- Afternoon, shoppers--
- Yo.

33
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,532
Hey, man. Is Mark Reiss here?

34
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,368
- Reissy? Oh, he left.
- Shit, really?

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,569
- Yeah.
- Damn it,

36
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,271
he was supposed to be here.

37
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,873
- It's kind of lousy out,
if you didn't notice.

38
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,909
He left early. Are you
interviewing for stock boy or--

39
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,246
- Me? No.
My name is Jay Bahadur.

40
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:31,416
I'm doing market research
on premium napkins.

41
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,752
Mind if I ask you
a few questions?

42
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:39,791
- Your name isn't even on here.
- I assure you, I am legit.

43
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,260
- You drove all the way
from Toronto

44
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,795
to ask questions about napkins?

45
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,699
- Premium napkins.
- Thought my job sucked.

46
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,635
- Could you show your
paper product aisle?

47
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,771
- But I'm just kind of busy.

48
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,542
- Is there a reason why the six
--reason why the six pack

49
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:58,844
This thing does not like me.

50
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,760
Is there a reason why
the six pack paisley napkins

51
00:03:14,762 --> 00:03:21,567
are here and not here?

52
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,535
It's not a trick question.

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,971
- I--I think because it was just
easier putting them on the floor

54
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:29,875
than on the top shelf.

55
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:33,879
- And would making our packaging
more festive make you consider

56
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:38,383
moving the premium napkins
to the top shelf?

57
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,723
You're probably thinking

58
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,558
that a person
with my intellectual capacity

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,960
would loathe waiting for
that gentleman's answer

60
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,995
to my question.

61
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:53,532
But actually,
I feel quite the contrary.

62
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,933
- I would just leave them
on the bottom shelf, man.

63
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:57,803
It's less work.
- Less work.

64
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,472
Understanding what drives a mind
to react the way

65
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:04,343
it does to things
never ceases to amaze me.

66
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:07,946
My careful documentation of this
one man's opinion could,

67
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,849
in its own way,
reshape the patterns of napkins

68
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:16,488
on every home on this street,

69
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:20,726
including that one,
my ex-high school girlfriend,

70
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:23,262
Tracy Zicconi's house.

71
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,597
The darkened second-floor
window just a reminder

72
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:30,802
that she now resides
1,825 miles away at Stanford.

73
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,572
And I know it's 1,825 miles away

74
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:36,408
because I have an obsession
with Google Maps,

75
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,278
not with my ex-high
school girlfriend.

76
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,822
I was raised as a non-practicing
Hindu-Christian

77
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:53,558
half-Indian living
at this address.

78
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,062
This is the home of Kailash
and Maria Bahadur.

79
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,398
My well-laid-out graduation plan

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
was only to visit my former
residence on festive holidays

81
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:04,403
such as Canadian
Thanksgiving and Christmas,

82
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:08,940
perhaps offering my skills at
turkey basting or tree trimming,

83
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,844
but this was 2008.

84
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,347
Plans evaporated.

85
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:18,583
Upon my graduation from the
esteemed University of Toronto,

86
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:22,754
my parents had decided
to give me my own mailbox.

87
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,856
They saw it as a way in which
to somehow legitimize

88
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,759
my residence in their basement.

89
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:29,494
The funny thing was
that the mailman

90
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,862
refused to deliver
my mail there,

91
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,764
so Mom would sort the mail

92
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,334
and deliver it herself
after each delivery.

93
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,680
"Dear Mr. Bahadur,
the editorial staff

94
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,382
"at 'Vanity Fair' has reviewed
your story submission,

95
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:53,752
"and we unfortunately do not
feel

96
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:54,920
"it's something we would like
our magazine

97
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,955
"to pursue at this time.

98
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,090
We wish you the best of luck
at other publications--"

99
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:00,926
Blah fucking blah.

100
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:03,929
Why do all rejection letters
have the word "unfortunately"

101
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,031
in the first sentence?

102
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,768
Surely there is a more original
adverb to toss in there.

103
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,039
I vow that I will never
write for a publication

104
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,576
that uses the word
"unfortunately"

105
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:20,579
in their first sentence.

106
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,014
I am better than that.

107
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,574
Come on.

108
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:54,646
Jared? Jared?
Jared.

109
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,718
Is that my Red Bull?
- No.

110
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,554
- Look at me.

111
00:07:02,556 --> 00:07:04,456
- Mom says you got to shovel
the snow in the driveway

112
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,158
so Dad can get in.

113
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,893
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,930
- You're not doing anything.
- Doing homework.

115
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:15,167
- Uh, where's mom?
- The elusive pink

116
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,769
fairy armadillo
has been known to--

117
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,439
- Mom? Mom?

118
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:21,907
- Yeah?

119
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,109
- Why do I have to
shovel the driveway?

120
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,913
- Your father and I
discussed this with you, Jay,

121
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,817
about ways for you
to contribute rent, remember?

122
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,020
And I'm so sorry about
your rejection letter.

123
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,690
Ahh!

124
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,662
- Yo!
- Ahh!

125
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:47,065
Are you, like, earning some
extra allowance or something?

126
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,201
- I'm starting to wonder why
I didn't commit teen suicide

127
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,036
when I could.
- Amen.

128
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:53,872
Yo, bro, you want to, like,
hit Parrots with us?

129
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,141
- Can't. I got to submit
my research numbers.

130
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,876
They got to be
in Chicago by tomorrow.

131
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,811
- Then fake it.
- I can't, man.

132
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,214
They figure out all sorts
of stuff based off my results.

133
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:04,716
- Like what?
- Like what holiday paisleys

134
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:06,551
are popular and stuff.

135
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,253
- Okay, bro, you lost me.

136
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,888
- Journalistic integrity,

137
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,523
it's gonna be worth
something on the resume

138
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,158
when I apply to Harvard's
journalism school.

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,062
- Right, right.
- Hey, I got an idea for a story

140
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,497
I'm gonna submit.
It came to me when I was

141
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,265
listening to CBC Radio today.

142
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,833
- What's--what's the angle?

143
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,035
- The end of the comedic
dictator.

144
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,005
Kim Jong is on his death bed,
and once he goes,

145
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:30,175
where's the dictator
comedy gonna come from?

146
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,912
- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
He's funny and very alive.

147
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,780
- He's not funny.

148
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,782
- He's a little funny.

149
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,118
- He's a little funny, but no
one can pronounce his name.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,621
- Your story is flawed, bro.

151
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:45,590
- You guys want to hear
something fucked up?

152
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,527
Tracy's getting engaged.

153
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,696
- Where did you hear that shit?
- Mm, Kate.

154
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,599
She said she saw
it posted on Facebook.

155
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,802
She's gonna marry her
Lit professor.

156
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,705
- No way. Tracy is repulsed
by older men.

157
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,940
- You were older.

158
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,142
- Two years is not older, man!

159
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,144
- It's a little bit older.

160
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,580
- Fuck you, Crowe.

161
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,783
- Hey, are you sure you don't
want to hit Parrots with us?

162
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:13,318
- No, dude, I got to--

163
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,155
- Do some shit nobody
gives a fuck about?

164
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,057
- Exactly.

165
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,092
- All right, well,
that is your loss,

166
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:25,263
but if you change your mind,
please hit us up.

167
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,300
- You got it. Later, dudes.
- See you, buddy.

168
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:31,836
- See you.

169
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,140
- Fucking moron.
- What?

170
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:42,213
- Ahh! Ahh!

171
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,985
- Name's Bahadur, here

172
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,653
to see Dr. Fleshman
about my back.

173
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,822
- Have you ever been here
before?

174
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,591
- No.
- All right, you'll just need

175
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:56,795
to fill out these forms.
- Right.

176
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:57,963
- You okay?

177
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:00,932
- Yeah, I just hurt my back,

178
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,268
figured I'd get a jump
on being a senior citizen.

179
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:15,647
- So, you busting on grey hairs?
To make a move on Kaitlyn, eh?

180
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,086
- Excuse me?

181
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,988
- That's all right,
I understand.

182
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,025
I'd take down all of humanity
just to bang her.

183
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,996
- Seymour.
- Ooh. I was just talking.

184
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:33,365
I'm trying to keep it
a level playing field.

185
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:35,400
- Yeah, leave him alone.
- You know what I'm saying.

186
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:39,004
Sorry. What happened
to your back?

187
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,706
- Sh-shoveling.
- Shoveling?

188
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,677
- Yeah.
- I got, uh, shrapnel moving

189
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,812
around the vertebrae.

190
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,881
It's a bitch.

191
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,950
- Well, sounds like I got the
better end of the deal in here.

192
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,918
- Oh, bullshit.

193
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,958
Shoveling? I hate shoveling.
Pointless waste of time, no?

194
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,961
Name's Seymour Tolbin.

195
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:06,097
- Ah.
- Oh, oh, sorry.

196
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:10,902
- Wait, Seymour Tolbin?
- Yeah.

197
00:11:10,904 --> 00:11:13,004
- The--who writes for
"The Daily Mail?"

198
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,807
- Wrote.
I'm retired, sort of.

199
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,876
But that's right. That's me.

200
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,444
- Holy fuck.

201
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:23,682
You are one of my favorite
journalists of all time.

202
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,985
- Come on. You Facebook people
have favorite journalists?

203
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,287
- You were one of the
first reporters who had the guts

204
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:32,023
to report the Battle of
Ong Thanh as a loss.

205
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,727
- That's--
So you're a journalist?

206
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,696
- No. Well, I mean, yeah,
I want to be,

207
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,998
but I can't--I just--you know,

208
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,101
I haven't taken a--
I never took a class,

209
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,470
but I'm seriously--I'm thinking
about going back

210
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:46,905
to get a degree.

211
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,140
Harvard is the--is the goal.

212
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:53,178
- Oh, how can you say
something stupid like that?

213
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,780
- What--
- Why do you think journalism

214
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,449
is a pile of "People" magazine,

215
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:02,887
"She got cellulite on her
Dumpster" crap right now?

216
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,458
Journalism isn't taught.
It's innate.

217
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,793
You know what I'm saying?

218
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,930
You think the shrapnel
in my back landed there

219
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:15,033
because I was using my head?

220
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,901
No way.

221
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,971
- So what are you saying?
- I'm saying fuck Harvard,

222
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,873
is what I'm saying.

223
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,042
Fuck Harvard.

224
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:28,947
You want to make it as some big
swinging dick journalist?

225
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,785
You got to go somewhere
fucking crazy.

226
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,854
- Somewhere where Western
reporters would consider

227
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,756
it too dangerous to go,

228
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:42,026
like, write as a stringer
from there, get a book going.

229
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:43,528
It's the only way out.

230
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,099
- Yeah, that makes sense, man.
That makes sense.

231
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:52,070
Where you thinking of going?

232
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:56,975
- Somalia.

233
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,877
Hmm?
- Like, I--I bought a--

234
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,547
An umbrella from a Somali once.

235
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,282
- What does that mean?

236
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,217
- That means where's
the fucking conflict,

237
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,787
besides the fact that they
machete reporters to death?

238
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,188
- In Somalia the seeds
of democracy

239
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,856
are growing amidst anarchy.

240
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,391
I did a paper on it
my freshman year.

241
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,393
- So?

242
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,529
- So it's a misunderstood place.

243
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:20,565
- Bro, democracy is not topical,
all right?

244
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,301
No--nobody wants
to understand Somalia.

245
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,172
- Did you know in Somaliland
they held an election

246
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:32,043
where the minority clan won the
presidential office by 80 votes,

247
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,078
and there was no violence?

248
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,247
The transition of power
was peaceful.

249
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,350
- It was peaceful because nobody
bothered reporting on it.

250
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:44,222
You need to listen to me.
You want conflict?

251
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:47,492
You want to tell the story
from both sides?

252
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,360
Go to Sudan.

253
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:54,232
There's your ticket,
not Somalia.

254
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:58,570
- I don't know, man. I got
a good grade on that paper.

255
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,539
Somalia and me are copacetic.

256
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,875
Is a Mr. Trey Williamson here?

257
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,277
- Just left.
- Shit, really?

258
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,413
My name is, uh, Jay Bahadur.

259
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,081
I'm here to conduct
a marketing research--

260
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,917
- Who's the guy eating Doritos
on my aisle?

261
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,588
- That's my associate,
Mr. Felcher.

262
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,624
- I have to clean that shit up.
- I'm so sorry, man.

263
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,459
- Would you please--
- Continue maestro.

264
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,362
- Refrain from eating
in this poor man's aisle?

265
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,964
And just start to pick that up.

266
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:26,965
- I got it.
- Thank you.

267
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,366
- I got it.

268
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,202
- And where is your, uh,
napkin aisle?

269
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,937
- Aisle seven.
- Seven.

270
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,873
- Hey, uh, Jay?

271
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,507
I think you should
check this shit out.

272
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,643
- I thought we agreed
you would be silent, bro.

273
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:42,213
- No, bro, I really think
you should check this out.

274
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,986
Would you excuse me
for a moment? Thank you.

275
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,288
What the fuck, man?
- The rebels,

276
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,123
who Kenyan officials
liken to seagoing pirates

277
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,626
have taken captive the MV Faina,

278
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:57,362
a Ukrainian vessel,
off the Somali coast,

279
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,031
and they're demanding
an untold ransom.

280
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,400
Our correspondent, Mitch Kelp,
has more on the story

281
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,937
from outside the U.S.
embassy in Nairobi.

282
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:08,039
Mitch, what more
can you tell us?

283
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,641
- Well, Chrissy,
not a whole lot.

284
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,542
We are going off
an official press release

285
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,411
from the Kenyan government.

286
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,513
We don't have
a single source in Somalia,

287
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,482
and I'm sure as shit not gonna
get my ass shot over there

288
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:20,084
trying to find out
what would possess these, um--

289
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,287
Possess these crackheads
to take an unarmed tanker.

290
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,123
- Hmm. Well, Mitch, word here is
our corporate insurance policy

291
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,058
wouldn't cover you
in that hellhole,

292
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
and they'd hate to have
a lawsuit from your family

293
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:32,263
on their hands when they mail
you back in pieces.

294
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,266
- Thank corporate for
being so considerate, Chrissy.

295
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,602
Back to you.

296
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,139
- So until we can find
one crazy motherfucker

297
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:44,509
to head over to Somalia
and find out what's going on,

298
00:15:44,511 --> 00:15:47,612
we'll continue to take
uneducated guesses

299
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,249
as to who these pirates are.

300
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:54,018
Bahadur, answer the phone!

301
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,321
- And you've got to put
your bodies upon the gears

302
00:15:56,323 --> 00:16:00,091
and upon the wheels--

303
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,459
- Hello?

304
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,195
- Hello?
Is this Mr. Jay Bahadur?

305
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,130
- Yeah.
- This is Mohamad Farole

306
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,100
from Radio Garowe
over in Somalia.

307
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:11,069
I got your email.

308
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,304
So you are wanting to come
to Somalia for a book.

309
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,306
You are writing on the pirates,

310
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,508
and you're looking for people
to talk to here, right?

311
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:20,378
- Yes, exactly.
- I must say that is more than

312
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,548
any other reporter
has been willing to do.

313
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,550
You are the first Westerner

314
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,119
to actually ask to come see
what's going on here.

315
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,356
- That's unfortunate.
- Yes, yes, it's true.

316
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,524
I'll have a conversation
with my father,

317
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,294
accommodate your request.
- Okay, okay.

318
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:39,464
And, uh, how--uh,
you think your father

319
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:42,200
will be able
to make this happen?

320
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:45,269
- I would hope so.
He is our president.

321
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:55,413
- Assalamu alaikum.
- Uhh.

322
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,082
- That's Somali for hello.

323
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:02,520
I suggest you learn it, Bahadur.
I'm out of cigars.

324
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,156
Want to walk with me?

325
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,191
- Okay.

326
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,526
Yeah, this guy Farole called.

327
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,228
I just sent out some feelers

328
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,696
to a few Somali news
services, and boom.

329
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,598
- The president's son
calls you back.

330
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,133
- Yes! I never

331
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,601
get a break like that, never.

332
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,270
- Well, uh, you create
your own reality, chief.

333
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:20,438
- Well, if that was true,
we would all live

334
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,106
in a solipsistic universe

335
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,508
wherein we could do
whatever we wanted

336
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,109
without any further
consequences.

337
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,178
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

338
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,280
- Michael Topper, author of
"Channeling UFOs"

339
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,382
and "The Positive/Negative
Realms Beyond This World?"

340
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,252
- You read too much.
Fuck more girls, instead.

341
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:40,625
Speaking of which, I read
that writing sample you gave me.

342
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,527
- Bad?

343
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,496
- Why the fuck would you
write a piece

344
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:49,400
on how to get away
without paying parking tickets?

345
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,602
- I thought people would laugh.
- Laugh?

346
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:54,305
Parking tickets pay
for the roads.

347
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,241
The roads get you
out of this shit hole.

348
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,844
- So you hated it?
- No, actually.

349
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:01,679
I liked it.

350
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,816
It's not the second
coming of Hunter S. Thompson,

351
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:09,120
but you write
with a good conscience.

352
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,354
- You think?
- Yeah.

353
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,623
Don't let it go to your head.

354
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,660
Bravo.

355
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:20,865
So Avril Benoit,
you know who she is?

356
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,834
- Yeah, uh, she's on CBC Radio.

357
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,303
She did a great report
on Kenya a few weeks ago.

358
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:29,407
- Exactly.
She's a friend of mine, uh,

359
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:33,845
and I want to put you
in contact with her.

360
00:18:33,847 --> 00:18:35,546
- Okay.

361
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:39,217
- She's a good one
for feeding pages to.

362
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,887
So you got--you got
a book outline?

363
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,789
- No.
- Wrong.

364
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,592
You're formulating one, okay?

365
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,861
- I haven't. I mean, this is
all happening so fast.

366
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,130
I just--I Googled
"Somalia press,"

367
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,664
found Farole's name,
and sent out a blind email.

368
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,433
I had no idea this was
gonna blow up, none.

369
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,436
- Bahadur, you got
a book outline?

370
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,171
- No! That's what I'm trying
to tell you--

371
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:06,611
- Stop! Try again.
You got a book outline?

372
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,412
- I'm formulating it.

373
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,515
- I knew you'd get it
on the third try.

374
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,283
Come on, let's go.

375
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:17,355
So how much do you know
about Somalia?

376
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:19,390
- Uh, well, I did a term paper

377
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,425
on it my freshman year
at university, so.

378
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:22,827
- That's good.

379
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,564
Don't tell me the grade.
It's a start.

380
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,466
Immerse yourself in it.

381
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:29,901
You dig cigars?

382
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:32,570
- I never understood cigars.

383
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,639
- That's clever,
don't you think, Jo?

384
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,875
Okay. Save this.

385
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:41,846
By the time this thing
is over, you will.

386
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:45,449
Jo, thank you.

387
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:49,353
What else don't you understand?
I need to know that.

388
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,256
- The Jays are going to lose
Burnett to the Yanks.

389
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,792
They offered him 82.5 million
over five years.

390
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:58,296
Can you believe that?
- I have an announcement.

391
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:02,733
- What kind of announcement?
- Yes, what kind?

392
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:07,738
- Uh, I'm gonna go to Somalia

393
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,775
and write a book on the pirates,

394
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,977
try to get
some stories published.

395
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:17,648
- Somalia?
- I know what you're thinking.

396
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,586
I know you're thinking
it's batshit crazy, but I think

397
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:25,623
this is the only way
for me to become a journalist.

398
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,593
- AIDS.
- AIDS?

399
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,729
- Isn't that a problem there?
- I believe so,

400
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,565
but I'm going to write
about the pirates,

401
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,001
Dad, not sleep with them.

402
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:47,411
Excuse me,
it's my Somali contact.

403
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:52,883
Assalamu alaikum.

404
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:56,287
Shifted?

405
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,458
- He needs to do more yoga.
His shoulders are bad.

406
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,827
- Assalam--ciao.

407
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:15,673
- You okay, sweetheart?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

408
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:16,874
I was wrong though.

409
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,643
- Wrong?
- Yeah, apparently

410
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,778
there's an additional
$500 security deposit

411
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,046
I didn't account for.

412
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,583
- 500?
- Security deposit?

413
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,985
- Yeah, just for, you know--
You know, for, like, uh,

414
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,822
vehicles and such, insurance
policies, things like that.

415
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,561
Can I borrow $500?

416
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,902
- Welcome about flight 823 now
departing for Frankfurt.

417
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,671
At this time
we'd like you to put away

418
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:47,772
all your electronic devices--
- Excuse me, sir.

419
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,540
All cell phones must be off.

420
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,941
- It's just final words
to my ex-girlfriend

421
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,010
before I had to Somalia.

422
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:57,448
I'm, uh, basically looking for
a little sympathy, maybe a wow.

423
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,320
Personally, between me and you,
I'd settle for an LOL.

424
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,488
- Off, please.
- Right, right, sorry.

425
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,324
I want to take
a moment now to say

426
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,858
that not all the characters
in this film

427
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,327
are exactly like
they are in real life,

428
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,629
except for that stewardess.

429
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:14,098
I felt she needed to be
depicted completely accurately

430
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,101
in her total lack
of empathy for my pain.

431
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,103
Thankfully I only had to spend
the next eight hours

432
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,771
of my journey with her,

433
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:22,707
and then I'd get
a new stewardess,

434
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,875
and then another stewardess,
and then another.

435
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:26,677
In fact, I might have set

436
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,579
a connecting
flight record to Somalia,

437
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,015
but see, this was all part
of my master plan,

438
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,751
a fixed budget that would
allow me to write my book,

439
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,453
and unlike several
of my predecessors

440
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:37,455
who ventured to
where that flag is,

441
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,558
I'd say alive, as kidnapping
and killing journalists

442
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,926
had become an
unfortunate trend here.

443
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,696
Dude.

444
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,040
Fuck! Stop!

445
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:33,878
Stop the fucking--Seymour?

446
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Tracy?

447
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,615
I thought you were
repulsed by older men!

448
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:43,954
- Please calm down!
- Make out with me!

449
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:48,726
Make out with me now!
Ahh!

450
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,594
Believe it or not,
that is what I consider

451
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,996
a mild Tracy nightmare.

452
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:55,733
Sorry, sorry, man.

453
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,668
In order to
clear my mind of its negativity,

454
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,970
I'll take a moment now to focus
on the less fortunate

455
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:04,608
than myself,
the people of Somalia.

456
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,112
Hard to believe this land was
once known as a nation of poets.

457
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,614
Throughout their history,
the Somali poet was counted on

458
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,683
to defend a clan's honor.

459
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:14,485
They used poems of persuasion

460
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:17,154
in lieu of weapons
to settle disputes,

461
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:20,458
but in the 20th century
times changed.

462
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,826
Both the English
and the Italians

463
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:24,128
attempted to colonize them.

464
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,130
They introduced guns
into battle,

465
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,233
and although Somalia
valiantly refused to succumb,

466
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:32,870
the scars of war never relented.

467
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:35,873
Somalia's recent civil war
had caused over a million people

468
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:39,043
to flee to neighboring
countries as refuges.

469
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:43,247
Those who stayed faced droughts,
floods, famine,

470
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:46,250
feuding clan battles, and jihad.

471
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:49,487
Their newly-elected President
Farole had his hands full,

472
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:53,090
especially when you threw
in the pirates.

473
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,693
I arrived at my destination
city of Galkayo,

474
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:58,095
and into the fire I plunged,

475
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:02,733
or as my Somali translation
book said, "Dabka."

476
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,777
Holy fuck.

477
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,715
- Mr. Bahadur? Mr. Bahadur.
- Hi.

478
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:19,783
- Hi, welcome to Galkayo.
- Oh, thank you.

479
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,853
- Yes. I am Abdirizak.
You call me Abdi.

480
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,255
I am your translator.

481
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:25,623
- Cool. Good to meet you.

482
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,024
- Good to meet you, yes.

483
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,561
How was your flight?
- It was good.

484
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:34,164
- That's good. Oh, please don't
do the--with your finger here.

485
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,766
- This?
- Yes. Oh, please--

486
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,601
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

487
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,036
I'm--I'm so sorry. I--

488
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,804
- It's offensive.

489
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:41,972
- I'll keep the thumbs in
check. Thank you.

490
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:43,707
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

491
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,943
Your English is great.
- It's not perfect.

492
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:49,680
I try to learn from you
during your stay, Mr. Bahadur.

493
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:52,049
- Oh, please call me Jay.
- Jay?

494
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,617
- Yeah, Jay.

495
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,920
- Jay, you have one bag?
- Yeah, one bag.

496
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:58,856
- Oh, you're like Obama,
a man that knows what he wants.

497
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,658
- You know Obama?

498
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,293
- Of course. He will be great
leader for your people.

499
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,862
- Oh, I'm Canadian.
He's--he's not my leader.

500
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:06,297
- Of course he is.

501
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,033
Your people just don't know it.
Come.

502
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:16,206
♪

503
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:25,583
♪

504
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,855
So I hear you are
an author and journalist.

505
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:35,693
- Yes.
- Good, good.

506
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:38,696
There is so much to write
about in this country.

507
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,164
What is your subject?

508
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:41,665
- In a perfect world
I'd be writing

509
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:43,601
about your newfound democracy,

510
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:45,369
but, um, given the fact

511
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:49,239
that the West has broken off
all relations with you, um,

512
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:51,308
I'm here to write
about your pirates.

513
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,646
- You mean badaadinta badah?
- Bada-binda-bada? What is that?

514
00:26:55,648 --> 00:26:59,116
- It means saviors of the sea.
They are like Coast Guard.

515
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,318
You can never call them pirates.

516
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,287
- Okay. That's good to know.

517
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:08,092
- They have very strong opinion
on this, never pirates.

518
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:10,928
- Are they easy to find?
- Yes, of course.

519
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,098
They are people
with crazy money.

520
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,633
- So they walk freely?

521
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,235
- Yes, but our new
President Farole

522
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:20,170
has promised to change this.

523
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:23,207
He is a very tough man
who will bring much change.

524
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:26,844
Ah!

525
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,817
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, yes.

526
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,286
It's okay?

527
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,823
- Yes, yes.

528
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,426
Sometimes I feel like father
with little children.

529
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,228
They need khat.

530
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:47,031
- Khat.
- Yes. We must stop up here.

531
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,074
- In Somalia one hour
and already shooting

532
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,309
my first drug deal,

533
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:02,880
my kind of country.

534
00:28:02,882 --> 00:28:06,083
So khat is a drug?

535
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:10,320
- Yes, it's--it's a stimulant
leaf from Kenya and Ethiopia.

536
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:15,693
It's very addictive,
big problem here.

537
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:20,397
What's he saying?

538
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,233
- He wants to know
if you want to buy some.

539
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,070
- Oh, no, I--I--sorry,

540
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:28,005
I'm on a very fixed budget.

541
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,040
I didn't account for drug
money. I don't have any--

542
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,321
He wants you to try it.

543
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:48,192
- It won't kill you.
Yes, just bite down.

544
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,294
- What's the effects?

545
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:52,496
- Makes some people
want to have sex,

546
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:55,899
others very talkative.

547
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,871
- Ugh! Tracy was a great girl,

548
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,039
but, you know, she--what--what
are you gonna do?

549
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:03,440
She moves on. I move on.

550
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,242
I really doubt we'll ever
even talk again.

551
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:06,977
I mean, why bother, right?
Seems like a waste of time.

552
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,345
I mean, it's just gonna
confuse thing and make it

553
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,780
more difficult.
- Men and women

554
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:11,515
can't be friends.
- Exactly!

555
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,016
Exactly, that's
the same over here?

556
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:15,452
- Yes, it's a universal thought.

557
00:29:15,454 --> 00:29:17,354
- See, where I come
from, they debate it.

558
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,523
They debate it like
morons, like idiots.

559
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:23,393
- It's not a debate. It's fact.
We're reaching a checkpoint.

560
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:25,362
Please stay calm.

561
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,892
- Ah, Mr. Bahadur..

562
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,360
- Hi.
- So we finally meet

563
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,295
face to face, huh?
- Yes, nice to meet you.

564
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:01,932
- Nice to meet you, sir. Abdi.

565
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:04,535
You are younger than
I pictured, somewhat.

566
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:06,537
- Ah.
- Western reporters to me

567
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:10,040
are always so fucking unhappy.

568
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:14,077
- Well, I get even better
once I shower.

569
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,346
- Come on, come on.
Has Abdi been good to you?

570
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,248
- Yes, mad good, yeah.

571
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,851
- He's the best translator
in all of Puntland, you know?

572
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,252
- Oh, no, really?
- Yeah.

573
00:30:22,254 --> 00:30:23,921
We stole him from the pirates.

574
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:27,090
- Oh, you mean, uh,
badaadinta badah?

575
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,392
- Abdi, did you teach him this?

576
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,027
- Ah--
- This is not

577
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:32,062
our Coast Guard, Abdi,
they are pirates!

578
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:35,165
You must forget
the old guard's thinking.

579
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,867
They are pirates!

580
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:41,038
- Pirates.

581
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,606
- Mr. Jay.
- Hi.

582
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,275
- So what do you think of
the Radio Garowe newsroom?

583
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,977
- Nice.

584
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,413
- Does it look like
the ones in Canada?

585
00:30:49,415 --> 00:30:50,848
- Yes.

586
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,249
Yes, it does, a bit, yeah.

587
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,984
- It's amazing, huh?

588
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:55,886
- Is it a local station or, um--
- Oh, one minute.

589
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,388
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah, mostly it's local,

590
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,123
but, you know,
the guy is very famous.

591
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,159
He used to work for--
- This guy, famous?

592
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,464
That was my father's office.
He wants to meet us now.

593
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,233
- Your father?
The--the president?

594
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,469
- Yeah, we must go now.

595
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:14,471
- Fuck.

596
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:18,141
- Pirates are not the most
cooperative group to deal with.

597
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:22,079
- Mm-hmm.
- Look here.

598
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:25,549
The main pirates' clan
are dotted around here.

599
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:28,151
- Eyl.
- You know Eyl?

600
00:31:28,153 --> 00:31:29,953
- Yeah, that's where
they took the Farhina

601
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,622
and held it for six months.

602
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:34,992
- Precisely. Eyl is a fishing
town where they started.

603
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:38,428
I'm working on getting you
a meeting with Boyah.

604
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,331
- Boyah?
- Yes, he's a man Somali

605
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,333
calls Robin Hood.

606
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:49,439
- Robin Hood of the pirates?
- But it could take some time.

607
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:55,245
- How much time?
- Days, maybe weeks.

608
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,481
Is that a problem?

609
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,182
- No. No, no, that's fine.
- No?

610
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,584
- That's totally fine, yeah.
- Yeah?

611
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,286
- Yeah.
- Okay.

612
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:03,654
- Yeah, I'll just--I'll call
my publisher

613
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:07,224
and make sure it's all set,

614
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:09,092
finances,
extending it, and everything.

615
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,515
- My father just got in here
a couple weeks ago.

616
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:35,719
The transition of government
was entirely peaceful.

617
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,570
This is the reporter,
Jay Bahadur.

618
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,639
- It's an honor to meet you,
Your Excellency.

619
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,474
- Welcome, Mr. Bahadur.

620
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:01,011
So my son tells me you're
the next Mr. Bob Woodward.

621
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,747
- I'm not so sure about that.
- Why aren't you sure?

622
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,415
You have made it farther
into Somalia

623
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,484
than any of
your Western counterparts.

624
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:11,088
- With all due respect, uh,
I've always considered myself

625
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,390
more of a Bernstein
than a Woodward.

626
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,726
Bernstein was ugly as hell
and never got through college.

627
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:19,563
Overcame his shortcomings.
Uh, I find that admirable.

628
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:22,766
- He's a funny guy.
- Very funny.

629
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:24,768
- I would like to introduce you
to Colonel Omar,

630
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:30,574
who'll be the head of your
security team during your stay.

631
00:33:30,576 --> 00:33:33,510
- Welcome.
- Pleasure to meet you, Colonel.

632
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,112
- I'll protect you well,
Mr. Bahadur.

633
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:39,282
You're welcome.

634
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:44,721
- You have learned some Somali?
- Enough to be a bad tourist.

635
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:47,457
Um, is this okay?

636
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:49,493
- Of course.
That's why you're here.

637
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:53,030
My family and I spent our last
eight years in Australia--

638
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:56,233
- Is there a reason the six
pack paisley napk--are--

639
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,135
- And we--
- Not here?

640
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,537
Sorry. I'm so sorry,
Your Excellency. I'm just, uh--

641
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,305
I think because
it was just--

642
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,740
Trying to get this dang
thing working here.

643
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:07,644
Festive--festive--

644
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,383
Good to go.

645
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:17,220
- The people of Somalia asked me
to come back here

646
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,357
and to run for this office.

647
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,294
I never saw myself
being the president.

648
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,796
I am a businessman.

649
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:28,298
I am not a warrior
like my predecessors,

650
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,834
but here I am,
fighting to bring justice

651
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:34,438
to those who destroy
our country.

652
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,341
Have you seen a school since
you've come here, Mr. Bahadur?

653
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,510
- Uh, no, I must
admit I haven't.

654
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,647
- We have the fewest schools
in the African nations.

655
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:49,352
Do you know how hard it is
to rule here with a PhD

656
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:54,658
knowing the children I lead
have no chance for an education?

657
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,695
Their role models
of success are pirates.

658
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:02,532
The Western world thinks
we encourage this.

659
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:07,204
This must change.

660
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,873
Do you have a title yet?

661
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:11,508
- A title?

662
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,743
- For your future
bestselling book.

663
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:17,481
- Oh. Um, yes, of course.

664
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:22,385
Um, "Pirates."

665
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,321
- That's shit title.

666
00:35:24,323 --> 00:35:26,823
Just "Pirates?"

667
00:35:26,825 --> 00:35:32,529
- "Pirates of Somalia."
- Be more creative.

668
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:33,697
Be more creative.
- Creative?

669
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,398
- Yeah.
- Creative.

670
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,338

my father likes you.

672
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,743

- Yes, yes.

673
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,378
- All right.

674

- He knows you will bring
great things here.

675
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:56,186
- What if I don't?

676
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:59,456
- How can you not when people
read your bestseller?

677
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,358
- Ohh.

678
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,194
- Abdi, have you
found Boyah yet?

679
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,930
- Mm.

680
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,932
- Yeah.
- He will show up.

681
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:13,436
They're gonna take you
to your accommodations.

682
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,706
- Wow. Thank you, uh,
so much for everything.

683
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,909
- That's the beginning
of a better Somalia, Jay.

684
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:21,545
- Yes, I certainly hope so.
- Yes.

They are my sister's kids.

It's--it's usually
very quiet here.

from the sun,

710
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:40,657
is worth you being my guest.

Thank you.

of some service to you.
- Yes.

So yes, I need to advise you,

- Really?
- The whole time.

716
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,740
There are orders
from the colonel, Omar.

717
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:59,909
- He's not into sunshine?
- He's into keeping you alive.

718
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,879
- Fair enough.

00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,914
Oh, cute.

No worries. I'll make do.

Was thinking about growing
it out. What do you think?

724
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:15,458

- Good. That's great.
- Good idea.

You have a mosquito net?

- I do, definitely.
- Good.

729
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:24,968
Malaria is very rampant
here, as well as rats,

730

you must keep it inside the box.

732

733

Well, thanks
for everything, Abdi.

Oh, uh, one last thing.

Um, I kind of like to work
with things taped on the walls.

00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,124
- What does that mean?

782
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:43,092
- We're going now. Let's go.
- Now?

783
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:46,663
- I set up a meeting, yes, now.
- Shit, let's go.

784
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:48,831
- Let's go. Okay.

785
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:08,051
♪

786
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,634
- Where's he going?

787
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:00,169
- Now me and you meet him
under the tree.

788
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,038
Come.

789
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,375
- Okay. Okay.

790
00:44:05,377 --> 00:44:06,743
You know those
out-of-body experiences

791
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:08,144
where you look around and say,

792
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,847
"This shit
isn't happening to me?"

793
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:12,649
My only one I could compare it
to was when I got pulled over

794
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:14,017
for speeding in Kitchener.

795
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:15,318
Cop asked me
to step out of the car

796
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,854
'cause I had a blunt
in the ashtray.

797
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:21,958
- What is a blunt?
- You know, grass, marijuana.

798
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,293
- That isn't tolerated
in America?

799
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,129
- I'm Canadian.

800
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:29,232
- Sorry, bro, I forget.

801
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:30,833
- Well, please don't forget
when I get shot here.

802
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,269
I want my body sent
to the right country.

803
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:36,439
- No one will shoot you.
- Maimed, whatever.

804
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,118
- He wants to know
what's your shirt.

805
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,254
- My shirt?
- Yes.

806
00:44:51,256 --> 00:44:53,923
- Uh, this is a Blue Jays shirt.

807
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:59,429
It's the, uh, baseball
team in Toronto.

808
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:10,006
- He wants to know
who wears the number 15.

809
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:11,240
- 15?

810
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:14,410
Uh, that's my man, Alex Rios.

811
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:17,313
Uh, he's, uh, what you call
a five-tool player.

812
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,781
No one can touch him
in my opinion.

813
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:32,361
- He say as Somali people
number five is very important.

814
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,003
- As we pray five times a day,

815
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:44,340
and they say the liar
has five religions.

816
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:47,443
- Maybe that five explains
why Rios is such a monster.

817
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:55,318
All right, uh--

818
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,323
So Boyah,
um, Westerners call you

819
00:46:00,325 --> 00:46:03,893
a, uh--a pirate.

820
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,809
- He's saying he's not a pirate.

821
00:46:19,811 --> 00:46:23,446
He is someone
defending his oceans.

822
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,281
- Badaadinta badah?
- Yes.

823
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:30,419
Yeah.

824
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:34,323
- He was a lobster diver
from Eyl.

825
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:43,099
- The Westerners come, Chinese,
the Koreans, uh--

826
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,503
- And they
overfished the waters.

827
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:54,443
- So they must pay for
their illegal actions.

828
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,179
- So you attack
their fishing vessels.

829
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:05,488
- He takes the taxes that the
government's supposed to take.

830
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,356
That's all he's doing.

831
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,994
And they never kill anyone.

832
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,930
Never?

833
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:17,500
- Yes, he said never,
not his men.

834
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:20,303
- Who are your merry men?

835
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:22,305
Or men--just say men.

836
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,613
- It's 500 men based in Eyl.

837
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,323
- He's the one that
gathered them together,

838
00:47:40,325 --> 00:47:45,595
and he's also the one
that pays them their wages.

839
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:48,464
- Wow, impressive.

840
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:53,436
So how do you pick someone
worthy of your confederation?

841
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,982
- First, he must own
his own gun.

842
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:08,484
That's why he show you the gun.

843
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:13,222
- Right.
- And they must be ready to die.

844
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:18,060
- He wants to know
if you have khat for him.

845
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,462
- Khat?

846
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:22,431
No, uh, sorry, I--no,
I--wha--

847
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,538
What the fuck?
What just happened?

848
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,274
- You were supposed to bring
the khat to him!

849
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:33,075
- I'm supposed to bring drugs
to this interview?

850
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,644
- Yeah, you should know.
- You didn't tell me that!

851
00:48:34,646 --> 00:48:35,978
How am I supposed to know that?

852
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,346
- You didn't research it?

853
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:39,015
- It's not on fucking
Google, man.

854
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:41,017
I don't know what to tell you.

855
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,618
- Yeah, you don't come to
with no khat.

856
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:45,288
- Great.
- Jay Bahadur, now you know.

857
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,990
Mm.

858
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:02,705
- CBC, Avril Benoit's office.
- Hi, this is Jay Bahadur.

859
00:49:02,707 --> 00:49:04,173
I'm calling for Ms. Benoit.

860
00:49:04,175 --> 00:49:06,008
I believe she's expecting
my call.

861
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:08,244
- One moment, please.

862
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:10,413
Avril, I have a Jay Bahadur
on the line.

863
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:12,648
He says you're
expecting his call.

864
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,953
- I don't know a Jay Bahadur.
- Okay.

865
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:19,055
I'm sorry, she can't be
reached at the moment.

866
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:21,223
Uh, can she return, Mr. Bahadur?

867
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:24,427
- No, it'd be impossible
to return. I need to talk now.

868
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,262
It's critical.

869
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:29,031
- Well, unfortunately,
she's unavailable.

870
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,100
- No! Please, uh--

871
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,436
What's your name?
- Beth.

872
00:49:33,438 --> 00:49:36,372
- Beth, hey, Beth.

873
00:49:36,374 --> 00:49:39,375
Um, there's gonna be a moment

874
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:42,678
when you're not on
that desk screening calls,

875
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,181
and you're gonna need a break,
a single tiny break

876
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:47,616
from the assistant
on the other end,

877
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,152
and that karma
is gonna be paid off

878
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:54,590
by giving me a break
in this very moment.

879
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:57,560
- You think it gets me a raise?
- Definitely.

880
00:49:57,562 --> 00:50:02,365
Just tell her
that I'm in Somalia.

881
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:06,369
- Okay, fine. You win.

882
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:09,205
Jay Bahadur says
he's calling from Somalia.

883
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,108
- Oh, shit.
Jesus, yeah, I'll take it.

884
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,509
Hello, this is Avril Benoit.

885
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:16,178
- Hi, Ms. Benoit.
This is Jay Bahadur.

886
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,147
I believe Seymour
told you about me.

887
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:20,616
- Yes, yes. Are you really
calling from Somalia?

888
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:23,252
- Yes, I'm in Garowe,
all limbs intact.

889
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:24,553
- Jesus.
- Look, I sent you

890
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:26,522
a proposal, uh,
regarding a book

891
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,324
I'm writing on the pirates.

892
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:30,292
I don't know if you had
a chance to review it.

893
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:33,162
- I'm gonna be honest
with you, Jay, I haven't.

894
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:34,663
Are you really there?

895
00:50:34,665 --> 00:50:37,066
- Yes, yes, I am.

896
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:40,603
Um, I'm being hosted
by President Farole's son.

897
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,471
- Christ, this is unreal.

898
00:50:42,473 --> 00:50:45,574
No one's in there,
CNN, BBC, no one.

899
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,276
- Yeah, I know.

900
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,646
- Oh, shit.

901
00:50:50,648 --> 00:50:52,381
- What the fuck was that?

902
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,283
- Ten minutes,
my--my phone card's out.

903
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:57,219
I--I'm--I'm tagging along

904
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,688
with a pirate the locals
claim is like Robin Hood.

905
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:01,557
He runs this huge
operation out of Eyl.

906
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,326
It is my hope that I can be
a stringer with you,

907
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:06,595
and if you really see
something in the pages,

908
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:08,631
you could help me
get a book deal.

909
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:10,833
Will--will you read my pages?

910
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:12,768
- Yes.
- Yes!

911
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,603
Thank you. Thank you so much.

912
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,439
Uh, I'm a huge fan, by--

913
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:20,376
- He said he was a lobster
diver from Eyl.

914
00:51:26,184 --> 00:51:29,418
- The Westerners come,
Chinese, the Koreans.

915
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:34,557
- Jay! Gabar!

916
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,429
- You're a good wingman, Asad.

917
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:45,134
Nice! Nice, buddy. Yes!

918
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:48,237
What?

919
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,506
What does that mean?

920
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:55,411
Keep your eyes on her, man.

921
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:00,282
Go, baby, go, baby, go.
Go, baby, go.

922
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:07,890
- You took the chair.

923
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,493
You took the chair.
You took the chair.

924
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:20,603
♪

925
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:52,668
♪

926
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,639
For the record, I am a complete
and utter disbeliever in destiny

927
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:59,675
bringing two lovers together.

928
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:02,311
It is a merely mathematical
probability that you will meet

929
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:06,815
the ultimate girl
of your dreams in your lifetime.

930
00:53:06,817 --> 00:53:09,952
These odds are increased
slightly by reckless behavior

931
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:14,290
and naiveté.

932
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:18,194
That is how I met Maryan.

933
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:36,679
Assalamu alaikum Jay.

934
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:39,882
- Assalamu alaikum, Maryan.

935
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:46,555
- Yes, I see you in the window.
- You speak English.

936
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:50,359
- A little.
- Where did you learn?

937
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:53,495
- I watch a lot
of American movies.

938
00:53:53,497 --> 00:53:55,297
- Movies?

939
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:59,702
- Yeah. I love.
- That makes two of us.

940
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,337
- Yes?
- Yeah.

941
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:03,505
Uh, got movie posters
all over my room.

942
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:04,807
What's your favorite movie?

943
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,910
- I like "G.I. Jane."
- Really?

944
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:13,282
- Yeah. I like Demi Moore.
She's a very tough woman.

945
00:54:13,284 --> 00:54:15,451
- Yeah, especially
with that buzz cut.

946
00:54:15,453 --> 00:54:17,353
It's super butch.

947
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,488
I'm sure Demi Moore
would be honored, though,

948
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:22,391
to have a Somali fan club.

949
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:27,429
- The movie I think is
very wrong is "Black Hawk Down."

950
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:30,532
- Because, uh, it's about
what went down in Mogadishu?

951
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:34,703
- No, because it's about
our people,

952
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:39,842
and they do not use a single
person from Somalia in it.

953
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:42,578
It is wrong.

954
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,749
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

955
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,818
"Derka derka Mohammed jihad,"

956
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,323
That's what they were doing
the whole pathetic film.

957
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:57,559
- You just did "Team America."
That's crazy. Wow.

958
00:54:57,561 --> 00:55:01,497
- Yes, "Team America"
said many smart things.

959
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:04,600
- This conversation
is getting surreal.

960
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:07,536
- You know this city
talks about you?

961
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,872
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

962
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,907
- What are they saying?

963
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:15,577
- They're saying you're here
to expose the truth

964
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:18,981
about the badaadinta badah.

965
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:20,382
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

966
00:55:20,384 --> 00:55:23,552
- Well, I mean, I am trying,

967
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:28,524
but, uh,
what do you think about them?

968
00:55:28,526 --> 00:55:31,093
- I'm not the person to ask.

969
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:33,595
I'm married to one.

970
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:36,432
- Garaad.
- So you know?

971
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:39,034
- I know, yeah.
He's a very powerful man.

972
00:55:39,036 --> 00:55:40,736
I'm trying to meet him.

973
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:44,907
- Yeah, you and I
both want that meeting.

974
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:47,676
- You don't see him much?

975
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,979
- Not since I married him, no.

976
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,781
- Well, you'd be
a better treasure

977
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,384
than anything he'd find
on one of those ships.

978
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:58,354
- That's an American movie line.

979
00:55:58,356 --> 00:55:59,355
- Yes.

980
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:01,523
Maybe. I don't know.

981
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:03,459
But it's good though, right?

982
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:07,529
And true.

983
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,066
- You here for khat, yes?
- Yeah.

984
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:15,404
- So how much do you want?
- Uh, I don't know.

985
00:56:15,406 --> 00:56:17,973
You--you take
foreign money, right?

986
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,608
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

987
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,877
Okay. Uh, how much
will this get me?

988
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:28,050
- Wow, enough to make you crazy.

989
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,819
- Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

990
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:35,457
- Jay.

991
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:37,493
- I think it's time
to see Boyah again.

992
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:39,461
- Is that khat?
- No, it's spinach.

993
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:40,963
Yes, it's khat.

994
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:06,789
- So tell me, Boyah,
how do you attack?

995
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:12,194
- We attack in small groups.

996
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:17,499
- And we circle them
like wolves.

997

- Ah,

That's--Whoa!

1005
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,279
Hello? Hello?

1006
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:12,848
- Hello, Jay?
Can you see me okay?

1007
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,816
- Yeah, it's--I can.

1008
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:16,218
It's kind of a bad connection.

1009
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,921
- Oh, yeah, damn technology.

1010
00:59:18,923 --> 00:59:21,323
- Yeah, do you want
to call me back maybe?

1011
00:59:21,325 --> 00:59:23,158
- Uh, no, no, I can't.

1012
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,993
I'm kind of pressed
for time right now.

1013
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:28,630
- Okay, um, did you get
a response on my pages?

1014
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:32,334
- Yeah, uh, unfortunately
not everyone here

1015
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:36,939
is sharing the enthusiasm
I've got for them.

1016
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:42,945
- Did you say "unfortunately?"
- Yes.

1017
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:45,047
- Shit.

1018
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:49,751
- My colleagues feel that
as a book it's missing a hook.

1019
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,587
- A hook?

1020
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:53,822
Boyah's Captain fucking Hook
minus the eye patch.

1021
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,958
- I know. I'm--I'm as
shocked as you are.

1022
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,860
The material you're getting
is incredible.

1023
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:00,896
I--I didn't see this coming.

1024
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:04,232
Look, the three top-selling
books this year are "Twilight,"

1025
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:08,904
"New Moon," and "Breaking Dawn,"
so don't take it personal.

1026
01:00:08,906 --> 01:00:10,706
We're all up
against vampires, okay?

1027
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:13,008
- Personal? Avril, these people
are desperate!

1028
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,177
No one is willing to listen
to what they have to say!

1029
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:17,913
- I'm sorry, Jay. I really am.

1030
01:00:17,915 --> 01:00:20,983
Just know that
I'm on your side, okay?

1031
01:00:20,985 --> 01:00:24,653
- Okay.
- Are you okay?

1032
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:26,655
- Yeah.

1033
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:28,724
- Look, I don't--I don't know
if you'd be interested,

1034
01:00:28,726 --> 01:00:32,027
but I've heard that
CBS is willing to pay $1,000

1035
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:34,730
for any video of hostages
on the ships.

1036
01:00:34,732 --> 01:00:36,098
- Is this your way of saying
it's a dead end

1037
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,167
with your contacts?
- No.

1038
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:43,972
I know it's crazy
and borderline sensationalism,

1039
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,141
but it can really
get you out there.

1040
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,310
It could help sell this book.

1041
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,812
Plus I know money
must be tight for you right now.

1042
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,147
I've been there.

1043
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:56,952
- Right.
- Just keep at it, Jay.

1044
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,688
I'm gonna continue
to push for you on this end.

1045
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,890
There's a book here.

1046
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:04,960
- Okay. Okay, thanks, Avril.

1047
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,663
- One more little
piece of advice,

1048
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,766
you might want to organize
your cards a little better.

1049
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:12,901
It's a pet peeve of mine.

1050
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:18,040
I just--I find it makes your
flow of thoughts more concise.

1051
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:31,353
- Fuck! Fuck!

1052
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:34,956
Fucking fuck!

1053
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,960
Hey, bro, uh--

1054
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,762
- Jay.
- Can we talk?

1055
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:42,097
- Now?
- Yeah.

1056
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,332
- Come.
- Thanks.

1057
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,201
Thanks, man. How you doing?
Sorry to wake you up, man.

1058
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:50,906
I'm just having a hard time,
man, you know?

1059
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:52,908
I trust you, man.

1060
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,810
- Thank you.
- No, I mean that, you know?

1061
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:57,045
Like, I really--I really trust
you because, you know,

1062
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,447
I don't really have
many people that I trust,

1063
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:00,749
and you're, like,
one of those people, so.

1064
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:02,417
- Is there something
troubling you, bro?

1065
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,052
- Don't call me bro, please.

1066
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,921
Call me Jay.

1067
01:02:05,923 --> 01:02:07,355
If you still want to call me bro
after I finish telling you

1068
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:10,459
what I'm telling you,
then that's fine.

1069
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:11,927
- Okay.
- What I say has to stay

1070
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:13,462
between us, I mean it.

1071
01:02:13,464 --> 01:02:16,398
- Okay.
- Okay.

1072
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,468
Um, all right,

1073
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:26,241
Uh--

1074
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,777
I'm not a famous journalist,

1075
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:32,814
and I don't have a book deal.

1076
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:36,785
- Okay.
- No, it's not okay.

1077
01:02:36,787 --> 01:02:38,954
Everyone here thinks
I'm a famous reporter.

1078
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:44,826
That's why I'm here,
but I'm a fucking no one.

1079
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:47,796
- Jay...

1080
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:52,033
you are the only reporter

1081
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:54,202
willing to risk their life

1082
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:57,472
to show the struggle
of Somali people.

1083
01:02:57,474 --> 01:03:00,976
- Yes, yes, I know,
but you're missing the point.

1084
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:04,479
I'm not a reporter, okay?

1085
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,081
I thought I could come here

1086
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,050
and get a book deal
or publish some stuff

1087
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:11,987
once I sent some pages
to editors,

1088
01:03:11,989 --> 01:03:13,789
but they rejected me, man.

1089
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:15,056
They fucking rejected me
like every other

1090
01:03:15,058 --> 01:03:18,126
piece of shit
I've written! Fuck!

1091
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:19,961
Sorry. Sorry.

1092
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,964
- They rejected your work?
- Yeah.

1093
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,866
If Farole finds out,
I'm fucking dead.

1094
01:03:24,868 --> 01:03:26,535
I'm dead. He's gonna kill me.

1095
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:30,038
- Perhaps yes, perhaps no.
He understands rejection.

1096
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,439
It's a human trait.

1097
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:34,242
- I shouldn't have
come here, man.

1098
01:03:34,244 --> 01:03:36,344
I'm a fucking idiot.

1099
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:38,847
- Don't say that, Jay.
Don't say that.

1100
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:41,049
You had no choice.
- Yeah.

1101
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,551
I came here with the noble idea

1102
01:03:42,553 --> 01:03:44,186
of exposing the truth,

1103
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:49,291
and I lied
to everyone around me.

1104
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,393
- You wake me in the middle
of the night to tell me this?

1105
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:59,234
- I came here
to ask you a favor.

1106
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:02,437
- Ask me.
- Yeah, okay.

1107
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:09,010
I need you to help me get on
a ship and film some hostages.

1108
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,479
- Jay, that is not wise.
- I know it's not wise.

1109
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:15,517
I know that, but, you know, this
is the only way that people out

1110
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:20,021
there are gonna give a fuck
about what is going on here.

1111
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,256
It's the only way.

1112
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:22,991
- I don't believe that.

1113
01:04:22,993 --> 01:04:24,860
- Dude, CBS is willing
to pay $1,000, okay?

1114
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:26,595
I'll split it with you
if you can get me on a ship.

1115
01:04:26,597 --> 01:04:29,531
I'll split it with you.
That's $500, American dollars.

1116
01:04:29,533 --> 01:04:31,600
That's fucking great money, man.

1117
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:35,170
- Jay, it's not about money.

1118
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:38,106
Once you're on the ship,
we cannot protect you.

1119
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:40,141
The president
won't even allow this.

1120
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:42,577
- It's CBS.
It's the biggest network.

1121
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,179
- Yes, and your being

1122
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:46,448
a famous reporter
getting killed,

1123
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,317
that would seal the fate
for Somali people as terrorists.

1124
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,887
- And I'm not famous.
- Jay, you will be.

1125
01:04:51,889 --> 01:04:54,189
- Abdi, they're not
publishing my words,

1126
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:56,124
not a single fucking one!

1127
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,393
Nobody gives a flying
fuck about Boyah,

1128
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,996
the struggling fisherman
turned Robin Hood pirate!

1129
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:02,664
They don't fucking care, man!

1130
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,667
- Do you know Somali clans
used to fight with words

1131
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:07,402
rather than weapons?

1132
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,037
- I knew that, yes.
I did a paper on that.

1133
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:12,440
- So you know our
great freedom fighter,

1134
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:15,143
the poet warrior Mohammed
Abdullah Hassan, Sayyidka?

1135
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:16,645
- The English called him
Mad Mullah.

1136
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:18,680
- Ah, you know of him.

1137
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:21,583
- Yes, I do, and I also know
that iambic pentameter

1138
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:24,152
is not gonna solve
this problem, man.

1139
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,454
I got to get on a fucking ship.

1140
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:28,223
- I will do something better.
- Better?

1141
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:30,191
What the fuck--what's
better than that?

1142
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:35,196
- I was working to get you
in a meeting with the Garaad.

1143
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,531
- The Garaad?
- Yes.

1144
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:38,500
- The godfather of pirates?

1145
01:05:38,502 --> 01:05:42,270
- The man you want to have
crazy sex with his wife.

1146
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:44,139
- What makes you say that?

1147
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:47,208
- You don't think all
of Garowe know this?

1148
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:48,643
- Does Garaad?

1149
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:51,313
- If he know,
you wouldn't be here.

1150
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:52,514
- That's comforting.

1151
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:54,683
- He wants me as a translator,

1152
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:58,019
so perhaps I trade
for the possibility of him

1153
01:05:58,021 --> 01:05:59,454
and you in a room.

1154
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:00,689
- Then you're putting
yourself in danger.

1155
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:02,090
That's--I don't like that.

1156
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:05,093
- No, no, no, no, mm-mm.

1157
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:08,263
That's nonsense, Jay.

1158
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:09,497
- Why you helping me like this?

1159
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,166
Why you doing that?

1160
01:06:11,168 --> 01:06:13,969
- You are my bro.

1161
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:16,004
I have to help you.

1162
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:17,105
- Thanks, man.
- Okay?

1163
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:18,740
- Thank you.

1164
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:21,543
- You're my bro, Jay.
- Whew, yeah.

1165
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:24,612
- Don't worry, okay?
- Okay. We're good.

1166
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:28,249
- Okay. Mm-hmm.
Have a good night.

1167
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:32,420
- Edgar Allen Poe, Oscar Wilde,
Herman Melville, H.P. Lovecraft

1168
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:34,990
all had one thing in common.

1169
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:39,060
They died broke,
completely penniless,

1170
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:41,162
so I got to blame
President Farole

1171
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,665
a little bit for not asking
for all his money up front.

1172
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:46,034
After all, I am a writer,
not an accountant, right?

1173
01:06:46,036 --> 01:06:47,435
Rule number one in life, Asad,

1174
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,238
don't blow all
your money on drugs,

1175
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:53,508
unless it's definitely gonna
lead to some serious ass

1176
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:56,344
or a Pulitzer Prize.

1177
01:06:56,346 --> 01:06:59,714
This might not lead to either,
but I'd rather die trying.

- In the market in Garowe.

1246
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,639
- He thought so. You got it
from one of his close dealers,

1247
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:21,576
so now he doesn't want
to waste a bullet in you.

1248
01:11:21,578 --> 01:11:27,382
- Good.
Thank you for not killing me.

1249
01:11:27,384 --> 01:11:29,984
Uh, don't tell him that.

1250
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:33,588
So, uh, tell me about yourself,
Garaad. Is this okay?

1251
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:37,458
Yes, yes.

1252
01:11:45,068 --> 01:11:47,635
- He have more
than 800 hijackers.

1253
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:55,076
- That is spread
from Bosaso to Eyl.

1254
01:11:55,078 --> 01:11:57,345
- That is a lot.
Very impressive.

1255
01:11:57,347 --> 01:11:58,780
Very impressive.

1256
01:12:00,583 --> 01:12:03,551
- Now, um, I recently did
an interview with Boyah,

1257
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:04,819
who's sort of a--

1258
01:12:08,391 --> 01:12:10,792
- He doesn't want to hear
anything about Boyah.

1259
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:13,628
He said he's a--he's
no one, you know?

1260
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,496
- Say no more. Say no more.

1261
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:17,699
I understand you're a very
different man from him,

1262
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,634
and I was just wondering if you

1263
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:21,402
could maybe elaborate on that.

1264
01:12:32,748 --> 01:12:38,019
- With his group,
it's a must to destroy anyone

1265
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:41,022
and everyone that's
doing illegal fishing.

1266
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:44,792
- Is it fair to say
that any ship

1267
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:46,594
that is traveling your waters,

1268
01:12:46,596 --> 01:12:50,698
be it fishing, cargo,

1269
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:57,071
yacht, that ship is fair game
for your organization to take?

1270
01:13:09,052 --> 01:13:11,052
- It doesn't matter
who they are.

1271
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:14,922
- They are doing
something wrong.

1272
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:19,627
They should be punished.

1273
01:13:19,629 --> 01:13:23,498
And we will keep going
till our seas are cleansed

1274
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,600
of illegal fishing vessels.

1275
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:27,635
- I am jamming.
Can you come back?

1276
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,404

of any of the--

Jay, Jay.

- Gather your things.

We're going to Eyl.

- Yes.

- Um, I got to get this Garaad
interview out, buddy.

1282
01:13:45,088 --> 01:13:46,888
- The ship will not
wait for you.

1283
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,523
- A ship?
- Yes.

1284
01:13:48,525 --> 01:13:49,857
There is a German freighter
called Victoria

1285
01:13:49,859 --> 01:13:51,559
being held in the harbor.

1286

The pirate in charge
is a friend of Colonel Omar.

1287

- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

1288

- Colonel Omar.

1289
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:58,833
- You can get me on a ship?
- You want to be on the ship?

1290
01:13:58,835 --> 01:14:00,535
- Yeah.
- Because I had to fight

both Farole and Colonel

- Dude, I thought you were
against me getting on a ship.

1294
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:08,810
- I am.
Farole tell me to collect $500

from you for costs
before you leave.

Do you have it?
- I don't have that, man.

1297

I'm broke.
- Come on, Jay.

- Yeah, you spent it
on pirate drugs.

1303
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,960
- Yeah, the pirates don't,

you know, give an interview
without the drug.

Farole words, man.

He's--he's a very exact man.

01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:04,351
- The colonel's contact on
the ship thinks it will happen.

1399
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:07,988
- All right.

1400
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:11,558
I am scared, Abdi.

1401
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,663
Shit, man, I mean,
there's no other way.

1402
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:18,265
I hope you understand that.

1403
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:22,169
- This is the path
you choose as a man.

1404
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:28,042
It's not for me to understand.

1405
01:22:28,044 --> 01:22:30,210
I am going to sleep now.

1406
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:33,013
- All right. Good night, buddy.

1407
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,687
Fucking A.

1408
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:01,241
- You stay here, man.
I will do the talking.

1409
01:23:01,243 --> 01:23:06,113
- Okay.
- Don't worry, brother.

1410
01:23:06,115 --> 01:23:07,982
- Okay.
- We'll make this work.

1411
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:11,719
- Good. Good, thank you.

1412
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:40,347
- Okay.

1413
01:23:48,256 --> 01:23:50,391
Is he saying no?

1414
01:23:50,393 --> 01:23:53,027
Fuck!

1415
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,698
I'm a journalist,
don't fucking shoot!

1416
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,100
I'm a journalist, it's okay!
Don't fucking shoot me!

1417
01:24:00,102 --> 01:24:01,635
Okay?

1418
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:03,337
The money is gonna come faster

1419
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:05,773
if you let me video
the hostages, all right?

1420
01:24:05,775 --> 01:24:07,708
Please don't shoot me.
Please don't shoot.

1421
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,577
Please don't sh--

1422
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:12,179
If you let me video,

1423
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:13,447
the world will see
you're serious.

1424
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:15,482
The world will see you
are serious,

1425
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:17,751
and the shippers
will settle. Okay?

1426
01:24:19,288 --> 01:24:20,287
- Tell your leader
Computer that.

1427
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:21,755
Tell him that! Please!

1428
01:24:21,757 --> 01:24:23,457
Please, okay?
It's true. It's true.

1429
01:24:23,459 --> 01:24:24,792
The money's gonna come
so much faster

1430
01:24:24,794 --> 01:24:26,527
if you let me video, okay?

1431
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:30,097
All right? It's true, I
promise. I promise, okay?

1432
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:39,339
- I will talk to Computer.
What you say could make sense.

1433
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:40,774
- Good.
- Come back tomorrow for answer.

1434
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:42,376
- Okay. Okay, great.
- Go. Move.

1435
01:24:42,378 --> 01:24:43,610
- Thank you.

1436
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,619
Abdi, did you see that shit?

1437
01:24:52,621 --> 01:24:53,787
- Oh, that was dangerous,
brother.

1438
01:24:53,789 --> 01:24:57,324
You didn't have to come out.

1439
01:24:57,326 --> 01:24:59,259
That was dangerous.

1440
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:03,097
- Fuck, dude. Oh, fuck.

1441
01:25:03,099 --> 01:25:06,200
Whoo! That's what
I'm talking about, Omar!

1442
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:07,434
- What was that?

1443
01:25:07,436 --> 01:25:08,802
- What do you mean
what was that?

1444
01:25:08,804 --> 01:25:10,504
- I told you not to
come down there!

1445
01:25:10,506 --> 01:25:12,439
- What was that?
You weren't gonna get me on.

1446
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:13,607
- Don't do this, man.
- You weren't gonna get me on.

1447
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,175
You weren't gonna get shit.

1448
01:25:15,177 --> 01:25:16,743
- When are you going
to listen, man?

1449
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:18,812
- I just got out there,
and I made it happen

1450
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:20,581
'cause that's what
I'm doing these days, baby!

1451
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:21,849
I'm making shit happen!
- You never listen, man!

1452
01:25:21,851 --> 01:25:23,717
Hey, hey, wake up, Mr. Bahadur.

1453
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:24,785
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
- What?

1454
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:26,220
- Wake up right now, man.

1455
01:25:26,222 --> 01:25:27,488
- We're in?
- Right now.

1456
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:30,290
- We're on. All right.

1457
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,733
It's gone.

1458
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:44,138
- Next time you follow
my orders, man.

1459
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:47,441
They thought you were CIA.

1460
01:25:47,443 --> 01:25:49,610
- You fucking serious? CIA?
- Yeah.

1461
01:25:49,612 --> 01:25:51,211
- Me?
- Of course.

1462
01:25:51,213 --> 01:25:54,481
- Fuck! Fuck.

1463
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:07,594
♪

1464
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:18,906
Abdi, not now!

1465
01:26:18,908 --> 01:26:24,778
- He say he's your father.
He call my phone.

1466
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,180
- My father?

1467
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:27,614
- Yes.
- Really?

1468
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:29,816
He called my phone.

1469
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:35,956
- Hello? Dad?

1470
01:26:35,958 --> 01:26:37,824
- Jesus, Jay, thank God
you're okay.

1471
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,760
We've been watching this whole
Captain Phillips

1472
01:26:39,762 --> 01:26:41,728
hostage thing on CNN.

1473
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:43,497
You've got to get
the hell out of there.

1474
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:45,465
- Dad, I'm fine.
What are you talking about?

1475
01:26:45,467 --> 01:26:47,267
- Those pirates are crazy.

1476
01:26:47,269 --> 01:26:48,835
They're threatening
to kill Americans.

1477
01:26:48,837 --> 01:26:50,504
- Dad, I'm Canadian.

1478
01:26:50,506 --> 01:26:51,772
I thought at least
you would know that.

1479
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53,507
- Not a time for joking, Jay.

1480
01:26:53,509 --> 01:26:55,542
We want you on
the next plane out.

1481
01:26:55,544 --> 01:26:58,245
- Dad, I understand your
concern,

1482
01:26:58,247 --> 01:26:59,846
but it's gonna be okay.

1483
01:26:59,848 --> 01:27:01,715
It's not a big deal.

1484
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:03,450
- Jay, sweetheart, you need
to come home.

1485
01:27:03,452 --> 01:27:04,751
- Hi, Mom.

1486
01:27:04,753 --> 01:27:06,753
I was just telling Dad I'm fine.

1487
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:09,423
- But we're watching CNN
right now, and it is not fine.

1488
01:27:09,425 --> 01:27:13,594
- Mom, the media is probably
spinning some bullshit tale.

1489
01:27:13,596 --> 01:27:15,529
I've heard nothing
about it here.

1490
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:17,531
- It must be the opium.

1491
01:27:17,533 --> 01:27:19,399
He's probably become
one of those child soldiers.

1492
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:21,235
- You're going to kill
your mother, Jay,

1493
01:27:21,237 --> 01:27:24,371
unless you say
you're going to come home.

1494
01:27:24,373 --> 01:27:27,975
- Okay, but I need money wired.

1495
01:27:27,977 --> 01:27:29,409
- Money?
- See?

1496
01:27:29,411 --> 01:27:31,245
It's the opium, I told you.

1497
01:27:31,247 --> 01:27:32,746
- Yeah, I didn't want to ask
you guys, but, you know,

1498
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:38,418
I'm really--I don't really
have a choice.

1499
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:40,687
Somalia's expensive. Who knew?

1500
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:48,629
- Reports are now three
U.S. Navy ships

1501
01:27:48,631 --> 01:27:51,531
are steaming toward
the Maersk Alabama.

1502
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:54,868
Taken by pirates--

1503
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:57,537
- The destroyer,
the USS Bainbridge,

1504
01:27:57,539 --> 01:27:59,539
is on the scene.

1505
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,475
- Apparently Captain Phillips,
the ship's captain,

1506
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:03,877
has been taken hostage
by the fleeing pirates

1507
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:05,545
in a covered lifeboat.

1508
01:28:05,547 --> 01:28:11,618
- The pirates have been--

1509
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,553
The hostage standoff

1510
01:28:13,555 --> 01:28:15,922
ended today with the death
of the three pirates

1511
01:28:15,924 --> 01:28:18,392
and the eventual release
of their hostage,

1512
01:28:18,394 --> 01:28:19,860
Captain Richard Phillips.

1513
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:21,595
- Somali pirates--
- Somali pirates

1514
01:28:21,597 --> 01:28:23,630
throughout the country
reacted angrily,

1515
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:25,866
saying they will capture
and kill any foreigners

1516
01:28:25,868 --> 01:28:29,736
they find to avenge
their comrades' death.

1517
01:28:29,738 --> 01:28:33,774
- At this time no one is
taking credit for the operation.

1518
01:28:33,776 --> 01:28:37,911
We will get answers soon because
my father is demanding it.

1519
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:42,082
- Mr. Farole, three pirates have
been killed by the Americans.

1520
01:28:42,084 --> 01:28:43,750
There is going to be revenge,

1521
01:28:43,752 --> 01:28:45,085
and it's too dangerous
for Mr. Bahadur

1522
01:28:45,087 --> 01:28:46,820
to remain here in Garowe.

1523
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,955
- No, it's not.
I will keep a low profile.

1524
01:28:48,957 --> 01:28:50,524
- Just like you did in Eyl?

1525
01:28:50,526 --> 01:28:51,825
- Eyl was a mistake, okay?

1526
01:28:51,827 --> 01:28:53,493
- You keep saying
it was a mistake.

1527
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:55,362
- I messed up.
I'm sorry about that.

1528
01:28:55,364 --> 01:28:56,897
- It was a mistake.
- I was a little high strung.

1529
01:28:56,899 --> 01:28:58,865
- Don't be telling this.
You're staying here--

1530
01:28:58,867 --> 01:29:00,033
- Okay, I have learned from it,
and I'm all good now.

1531
01:29:00,035 --> 01:29:01,702
I'm not gonna do that again.

1532
01:29:01,704 --> 01:29:03,070
- Mr. Bahadur, I agree
with the Colonel, okay?

1533
01:29:03,072 --> 01:29:05,639
I think we have to
get you out of here.

1534
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:09,076
We do not need any harm coming
to you. Do you understand that?

1535
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:10,777
- I get that.
- Do you understand that?

1536
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:13,680
- Mr. Farole,
I understand that, okay?

1537
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,482
I understand your concern
for my safety.

1538
01:29:15,484 --> 01:29:16,983
- It doesn't look
like you understand.

1539
01:29:16,985 --> 01:29:18,418
- I understand the concern
for my safety,

1540
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:19,886
but you need somebody here.

1541
01:29:19,888 --> 01:29:22,022
I need to find out
who's behind this, okay?

1542
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:23,757
I need to interview them.

1543
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:25,425
- No, no, Mr.--
- So I can interview them.

1544
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:27,094
That's why you brought me here!
- No, no.

1545
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:28,662
- That's why you've been
protecting me the whole time!

1546
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:31,965
- People are dying, okay?
- Madness.

1547
01:29:31,967 --> 01:29:34,134
Khat's eating his brain.
- Khat?

1548
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:35,969
- Khat is not eating
my fucking brain.

1549
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:37,771
- It is. I can hear that.
- There's no one else here

1550
01:29:37,773 --> 01:29:39,740
from the Western media.
- Mr. Bahadur, calm down!

1551

1579

in my bag for Boyah.

If they let me open it,
I can show them.

No. No, no, no. No.

who's getting married to
someone else.

I nailed that shit. Hit it.

01:42:07,856 --> 01:42:11,858
- They say in Somalia,
every man is his own sultan.

1711
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:17,163
Then in my mind, Abdi was
a glorious kind among sultans.

1712
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:29,542
Upon landing back in the cell
zone known as Toronto, Canada,

1713
01:42:29,544 --> 01:42:32,712
I got 234 unopened
text messages.

1714
01:42:32,714 --> 01:42:35,181
165 were from news services

1715
01:42:35,183 --> 01:42:37,683
offering
to buy my Garaad interview.

1716
01:42:37,685 --> 01:42:41,521
Eight were from publishers
wanting to buy my book rights,

1717
01:42:41,523 --> 01:42:45,525
and four of them
were from Tracy.

1718
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:51,564
I decided if she really
wanted to know

1719
01:42:51,566 --> 01:42:54,300
what was going on in my life,

1720
01:42:54,302 --> 01:42:57,303
she could read about it.

1721
01:42:57,305 --> 01:42:59,539
- Excuse me.
Can I see your passport?

1722
01:42:59,541 --> 01:43:02,208
- Passport?

1723
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:10,316
- Follow me, please.

1724
01:43:20,494 --> 01:43:22,828
- Hello, Mr. Bahadur.
- Hello.

1725
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,298
- My name's Agent Brice.
I'm with CSIS.

1726
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:29,936
- Okay. Uh, is--am I in
some sort of trouble?

1727
01:43:29,938 --> 01:43:31,904
- Quite the opposite.

1728
01:43:31,906 --> 01:43:34,640
We're very anxious to learn
if you could give us any insight

1729
01:43:34,642 --> 01:43:39,378
that you may have gained
while in Somalia.

1730
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,315
- Wait, you want me
to give you insight?

1731
01:43:42,317 --> 01:43:45,551
- Look, uh, both the U.S.
and the Canadian intelligence

1732
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:49,789
are basically flying blind
in the region,

1733
01:43:49,791 --> 01:43:53,226
so we could use some help.

1734
01:43:53,228 --> 01:43:55,361
- Oh, my God.

1735
01:43:55,363 --> 01:43:58,698
Wow. Okay.

1736
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:02,235
Uh, this--my parents are, uh,
doing the circling thing.

1737
01:44:02,237 --> 01:44:04,637
- Right, okay. All right,
well, uh, tell you what.

1738
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:08,841
Why don't you give me a call
when you're settled in?

1739
01:44:12,846 --> 01:44:16,782
- Toronto had stayed perfectly
intact despite my absence.

1740
01:44:16,784 --> 01:44:18,784
I couldn't vouch for
the napkin patterns

1741
01:44:18,786 --> 01:44:21,721
inside each home we drove past,

1742
01:44:21,723 --> 01:44:23,823
but I had to guess
my painstaking research

1743
01:44:23,825 --> 01:44:25,925
did little to alter
the landscape.

1744
01:44:30,597 --> 01:44:32,331
- We don't want to upset you.

1745
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:33,866
We did not know
how to tell you this.

1746
01:44:33,868 --> 01:44:36,602
- Jared's been living
in the basement.

1747
01:44:36,604 --> 01:44:38,437
- What?

1748
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:41,674
- Well, you've been gone
for six months, sweetheart.

1749
01:44:41,676 --> 01:44:43,542
So, you know, um, he's sleeping

1750
01:44:43,544 --> 01:44:45,444
because he has exams
in the morning,

1751
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:47,446
so it's best that you enter
through the front door.

1752
01:44:47,448 --> 01:44:49,015
- Can I still use the shower,

1753
01:44:49,017 --> 01:44:51,050
or are the pipes
gonna wake him too?

1754
01:44:51,052 --> 01:44:56,322
- I think tonight we can
make an exception.

1755
01:44:56,324 --> 01:44:58,991
Fuck Harvard!

1756
01:44:58,993 --> 01:45:02,728
- Oh, my God!

1757
01:45:04,831 --> 01:45:08,934
- Fuck Harvard!

1758
01:45:08,936 --> 01:45:10,569
- I've never heard
you swear before.

1759
01:45:10,571 --> 01:45:12,605
- Yeah, well, it's true.
Fuck 'em.

1760
01:45:12,607 --> 01:45:14,707
My Jay beat all the odds,

1761
01:45:14,709 --> 01:45:16,042
and you're gonna
win the Pulitzer

1762
01:45:16,044 --> 01:45:18,911
from writing it in our basement.

1763
01:45:18,913 --> 01:45:22,648
- To Jay and his fucking
basement Pulitzer!

1764
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,617
- Yeah!

1765
01:45:24,619 --> 01:45:27,620
- Who's idea
was "Fuck Harvard?"

1766
01:45:27,622 --> 01:45:30,923
- Bahadur, you better tell me
you got laid at least

1767
01:45:30,925 --> 01:45:33,693
once over there, or I'm leaving.

1768
01:45:33,695 --> 01:45:36,529
On second thought,
don't tell me.

1769
01:45:36,531 --> 01:45:37,897
Booze is too good to leave.

1770
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,703
- You guys want to see
something really cool?

1771
01:45:43,705 --> 01:45:45,805
- Wow.

1772
01:45:45,807 --> 01:45:50,343
You should see
what he does with the bottle.

1773
01:45:50,345 --> 01:45:54,714
- Would I like mine
so--hey, man.

1774
01:45:54,716 --> 01:45:56,515
- What are you mumbling about?

1775
01:45:56,517 --> 01:45:58,851
- Well, I'm just thinking
aloud, you know?

1776
01:45:58,853 --> 01:46:02,621
- Okay. I like that.
I like that.

1777
01:46:02,623 --> 01:46:07,093
- So what's next, Bahadur?
- Next?

1778
01:46:07,095 --> 01:46:10,930
- What's gonna keep you from
spending all your nights

1779
01:46:10,932 --> 01:46:14,100
in the shadow of those guys?

1780
01:46:14,102 --> 01:46:17,636
- Well, I got a ton of work
to do on the book.

1781
01:46:17,638 --> 01:46:19,905
- After the book?
- After?

1782
01:46:19,907 --> 01:46:22,975
- Yeah.

1783
01:46:22,977 --> 01:46:26,812
- Take a look at that.

1784
01:46:26,814 --> 01:46:30,883
- 70-year-old men don't get
handed fucking business cards

1785
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:33,719
for a reason unless
it's a last rites priest.

1786
01:46:33,721 --> 01:46:35,087
What's it say?

1787
01:46:35,089 --> 01:46:39,492
- Agent T. Brice, CSIS.
- CSIS?

1788
01:46:39,494 --> 01:46:41,427
- Yeah.
- They talked to you?

1789
01:46:41,429 --> 01:46:46,799
- Yes, they did.
- What'd they say?

1790
01:46:46,801 --> 01:46:50,836
- They were anxious to listen
to what I learned over there.

1791
01:46:50,838 --> 01:46:52,738
- Anxious, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1792
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,907
- Anxious?
- Mm-hmm.

1793
01:46:54,909 --> 01:47:00,880
- Could bring an opportunity.
- That's what I think.

1794
01:47:00,882 --> 01:47:03,082
- Oh.
- Hmm?

1795
01:47:03,084 --> 01:47:06,419
- Christ, you haven't smoked
this fucker yet?

1796
01:47:06,421 --> 01:47:08,053
- Not yet.
I've been tempted though.

1797
01:47:08,055 --> 01:47:11,056
- You're hopeless.
- Give me the fucking thing.

1798
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:17,663
- That's Somali?
- Yes.

1799
01:47:17,665 --> 01:47:21,500
- What does it mean?
- "Tonight, we drink."

1800
01:47:21,502 --> 01:47:23,002
- Oh, that's good to hear.

1801
01:47:23,004 --> 01:47:25,871
I thought you were gonna say,
"Tonight we fuck."

1802

My name is Jay Bahadur.

1808
01:47:55,837 --> 01:47:57,169
I'm a Canadian citizen

1809
01:47:57,171 --> 01:47:58,838
currently living
in Nairobi, Kenya.

1810
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:00,105
I'm running
"The Somalia Report,"

1811
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:02,007
which is the largest and in fact

1812
01:48:02,009 --> 01:48:05,144
the only English-language
news site devoted to Somalia.

1813
01:48:05,146 --> 01:48:06,979
- Mr. Bahadur, you're
considered

1814
01:48:06,981 --> 01:48:08,547
one of the foremost experts

1815
01:48:08,549 --> 01:48:12,818
on Somali piracy, are you not?

1816
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,855
- I have some knowledge, sir.
- Some knowledge

1817
01:48:15,857 --> 01:48:17,756
would be an understatement.

1818
01:48:17,758 --> 01:48:19,825
Your book on piracy's currently
on "The New York Times'"

1819
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:22,161
bestseller list, is it not?

1820
01:48:22,163 --> 01:48:24,830
- Yes, that's true, sir.
- In your opinion,

1821
01:48:24,832 --> 01:48:26,699
what's the most
effective way for us

1822
01:48:26,701 --> 01:48:29,568
to combat
this current piracy trend

1823
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:33,272
and make shipping lanes
safe for our vessels?

1824
01:48:33,274 --> 01:48:36,942
- Well, that's a very
general question, sir.

1825
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:43,182
- Well, your best answer's
all we ask, sir.

1826
01:48:43,184 --> 01:48:45,784
- Okay.

1827
01:48:45,786 --> 01:48:47,653
I know there's a lot
of collective knowledge

1828
01:48:47,655 --> 01:48:49,788
in this room, so I apologize
if what I'm about to say

1829
01:48:49,790 --> 01:48:51,824
is old news to some of you.

1830
01:48:51,826 --> 01:48:54,793
I did a paper on the subject
my freshman year at university,

1831
01:48:54,795 --> 01:48:56,595
and it just stuck with me.

1832
01:48:56,597 --> 01:48:59,532
- A school paper?

1833
01:48:59,534 --> 01:49:01,267
- Yes.
- Are we gonna hear

1834
01:49:01,269 --> 01:49:04,136
your grade too?

1835
01:49:04,138 --> 01:49:07,540
- No, sir, that is classified.

1836
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:11,977
Um, in 2002 Somaliland
held an election

1837
01:49:11,979 --> 01:49:15,814
where the minority clan won the
presidential office by 80 votes,

1838
01:49:15,816 --> 01:49:19,818
and the transition of power
was completely peaceful,

1839
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:22,721
no violence, not one shot fired.

1840
01:49:22,723 --> 01:49:24,690
That doesn't happen
anywhere in Africa.

1841
01:49:24,692 --> 01:49:27,026
That doesn't even happen here.

1842
01:49:27,028 --> 01:49:30,996
Anyway, it caught my eye
and made me start

1843
01:49:30,998 --> 01:49:32,598
to fall in love with Somalia

1844
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:34,066
and ultimately made me

1845
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:36,569
go there to find out
what made them different.

1846
01:49:36,571 --> 01:49:38,203
After spending
my last five years

1847
01:49:38,205 --> 01:49:41,140
immersed in their
country's struggles,

1848
01:49:41,142 --> 01:49:45,611
they don't need your
warships off their coast.

1849
01:49:45,613 --> 01:49:48,781
What they need is to be
recognized by all of you

1850
01:49:48,783 --> 01:49:54,153
for the incredibly complex but
honorable culture that they are.

1851
01:49:54,155 --> 01:49:56,855
A fledgling democracy doesn't
make headlines like pirates do.

1852
01:49:56,857 --> 01:49:58,357
You guys wouldn't be
sitting here talking to me

1853
01:49:58,359 --> 01:50:00,292
if I wrote a book
on a fledgling democracy.

1854
01:50:00,294 --> 01:50:02,027
Hell, I couldn't even
afford this suit

1855
01:50:02,029 --> 01:50:05,831
if I wrote a book
on a fledgling democracy.

1856
01:50:05,833 --> 01:50:09,101
All I'm asking is that you guys
start to look at Somalia

1857
01:50:09,103 --> 01:50:10,903
in a different way,

1858
01:50:10,905 --> 01:50:13,872
not so much as them versus us,

1859
01:50:13,874 --> 01:50:18,110
but rather look at Somalia as us

1860
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,946
when we were young.
