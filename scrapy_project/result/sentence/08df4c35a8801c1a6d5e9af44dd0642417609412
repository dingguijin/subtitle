Today, we fight for the Grail.
Gawain!
The Grail! It is lost.
It's been 15 years.
Why are we still in Paris? What are we waiting for?
I have to go.
In my absence, you're in charge.
I want you to be Master.
King Philip
and Her Grace, Queen Joan!
Joan, you're the only woman I've ever loved.
It is not the job of the Templars
to put money in our coffers, De Nogaret.
It is yours.
Take this sword to a knight named Landry.
God's Kingdom depends on it.
- Where's his body? - At my house.
He should be laid to rest here.
Bring him home.
Were you wounded in the Holy Land?
What you see as a wound, I see as a gift.
Godfrey sent us a message!
The fleur-de-lis.
The Holy Grail is in France.
Come here, Landry. Don't be afraid.
He looks strange.
One day, you will see my body,
and I will look strange, too.
This is what we have to accept.
Why didn't the Templars run?
I saw other soldiers run.
If we had run, Landry,
everyone in this city would be dead.
Because we stayed, they're safe for another day.
For a man of Faith, death is not the end.
It's just a passing.
Like going through a door to somewhere new.
And when I go through,
know that I haven't gone far,
and that I'll waiting for you...
just on the other side.
Thank you for coming.
I am sorry.
Is there anything my wife or I can do for you
in this time of mourning?
You're too kind.
The Temple will find his killers,
and we will bring him home.
I have no doubt.
If the Royal Guard can assist, do not hesitate to ask.
Your Grace.
My condolences on the death of your Master.
- I know you must be saddened. - I am saddened.
But I'm also hopeful.
Hopeful?
Something has happened.
Something extraordinary,
that could change everything.
What on Earth are you talking about?
Meet me tonight.
I can tell you.
With pleasure, sir.
If you will grant me leave,
I need to return to the Temple.
Then return with our love and support.
Thank you.
We are receiving a most important guest today.
Pope Boniface is coming to Paris.
- Pope Boniface! - Thank you, Father!
- Pray for me! - Bless us, Holy Father.
Your Holiness!
Pray for us.
Your Holiness,
the Paris Temple is honored to receive you.
Sancti Apostoli, Petrus et Paulus.
Landry.
I'm sorry about Godfrey.
He was like a son to me and a father to you.
What do we know of his killers?
Highwaymen.
A farm-boy tried to help him, but it was too late.
Come. Take me to your chapel.
So it's true.
The Holy Grail is here in France.
But how is this possible?
It was at the bottom of the sea.
I saw the ship go down with my own eyes.
And this is all we have, this glass?
Did Godfrey ever say anything about the Grail?
Any suggestion about where he might be going,
where it might be?
Never.
Have you checked his effects?
Not yet.
One of our best knights has been dispatched
- to bring him home. - Good.
Look carefully.
Check his person, as well as his possessions.
Anything that could help.
After all these years,
the chance to reclaim
the Holiest relic in all of Christendom.
The Cup that Jesus drank from at the Last Supper.
And when we have it back,
we will launch a mission to reclaim the Holy Land.
Until then, say nothing of this.
- Of course. - Good.
Come with me.
In accordance with the Rule of the Order
of the Poor Fellow Soldiers of Christ,
I claim Pope's privilege
in appointing the Master of the Paris Temple.
I'm not ready.
You are ready. Godfrey knew it.
It's why he chose you above all others.
These are dark times,
and we need able men to lead us back into the light.
Landry du Lauzon, your sword.
Kneel, my son.
Where were you first prepared to lead the Temple?
In my heart.
And where was that heart tested?
On the field of battle.
By the Grace of God,
rise, Master of the Temple.
Rise, Master of the Temple.
And find us the Grail.
This is sacrilege, you know.
I don't take kindly.
I don't take kindly at all.
- You should let him rest in peace. - I'm sorry.
I have orders to bring Godfrey home.
A Master must always be laid to rest in the Temple.
Father.
Isabella.
Come. Look at you.
A little girl one minute, and now...
You will make a beautiful wife.
I've received this.
An overture.
Prince Lluis of Catalonia.
I know you're interested.
It's true!
I would be Queen of Catalonia.
An alliance with Catalonia could be interesting.
But let's not forget England.
An alliance in that direction could solve many problems,
not least the English King's thirst for war.
And I hear good things
- about his son, Prince Edward. - No!
- I want to marry Lluis. - It is not simply a question of what...
- We've been exchanging letters! - Damn you, girl! Enough!
You are still a child.
Trust me, and your mother.
Your Grace.
We will choose carefully.
Come in.
A message from Gawain.
It's bad.
Godfrey's body's gone.
His grave's been dug up.
Somebody's stolen it.
This is not simply highwaymen.
This is about the Grail.
We must find these men and Godfrey.
- Prepare the horses. - Leave it to me.
The last time a Temple Master rode out of these walls,
he was killed.
How well do you know me?
- This is a mistake. - But it's my mistake to make.
Lord, take this gentle soul into Heaven.
Grant our sister Marie Your mercy
and receive her into Your kingdom...
They tortured her before they murdered her.
I won't rest until I've done the same to them.
Leave it to God.
His justice will find them.
Well, not if I find them first.
Her Grace, Queen Joan!
The Pope would not come rushing to Paris just to bury Godfrey.
The Pope and the Templars are our allies.
Why do you always imagine
conspiracies and plots?
Your Grace, in the last 100 years,
the Templars, the Pope's personal army,
have unseated three kings...
Portugal, Cyprus, and Germany.
All the more reason to keep them friendly.
Let's remember our real enemies... Flanders...
弗兰德斯位于今比利时西部 包括荷兰南部及法国北部一部分领土的地区 \N11世纪成为欧洲最富有的地区
And think how we can prevent war with England.
You know the solution.
The English Ambassador is here.
Confirm that we will give Isabella's hand
to their Prince Edward,
and it will bring peace to France.
So would an alliance with Catalonia.
Their Prince Lluis is eminently suitable.
He and Isabella have been writing letters of courtship.
At least hear their ambassador out.
From the great Kingdom
South of the Pyrenees,
Rodrigo, Emissary of Catalonia.
Catalonia presents France
with treasures from both East and West.
Silk from the exotic lands beyond Persia,
and from our Island provinces, gold and spices.
And the English ambassador,
Robert, Earl of Oxford.
Sire, Madame.
I see our friends from Catalonia
have brought you baubles and trinkets.
King Edward and England
bring you something far more valuable...
Gascony.
And with it, lasting peace.
So considerate of England to offer us
what is rightfully ours.
And from what I hear,
the Prince would much prefer one of our sons.
My lady, think of Isabella to be Princess of France
and Queen of England.
Both is to be Queen of the World.
My lawyer wants England.
My Queen wants Catalonia.
I shall take the sudden arrival of our friend Boniface
as a sign from God
and take his advice.
You'll consult the Pope?
Mm.
What are you doing?
They took the north road.
There's two things that way...
The Dead Lake and the old Abbey at Mortremer.
And you're going after them?
On your own with farm tools?
You'll die within the day.
They killed my Marie!
And they killed our Master.
Now, I've sent for knights who are on their way.
You going after them now will not only get you killed,
it will warn them we're coming.
Please, I have to do something.
You saw what they did to her.
God and the Temple will avenge her.
I promise you that.
Now, go inside. And wait.
Thank you for meeting with us
at such short notice, Your Holiness.
Don't mention it, my dear.
You look as radiant and beautiful as ever.
I hear there may be a wedding in the offing?
Isabella!
Look at you. You look like a queen already.
Well, I'm hoping to be Queen of Catalonia.
This is why we wanted your wisdom...
To shed light on her love,
just as you did on ours so long ago.
There is Catalonia, but there is also England.
You want me to adjudicate?
God grant me the wisdom
to make a match as successful as yours.
If I might have a word, Your Holiness?
Found God yet, De Nogaret?
Not yet, Your Holiness,
despite looking in all the usual places.
You have a momentous decision before you.
I wanted to offer my counsel.
The Almighty is my counsel, De Nogaret.
Should any legal quandaries arise,
I'll be sure to summon you from your ink pots.
The Grail is here? Well, where?
We don't know.
But we need to find Godfrey and these highwaymen.
Why would they take Godfrey's body?
That's what we're here to find out.
Bring the boy.
- He's mad with grief. - Yes,
but he's the only one who's seen Godfrey's killer.
Parsifal!
Lad.
Hyah! Move!
Hyah! Hyah!
Parsifal!
If he gets there first, they'll know we're coming.
Come on! Quickly!
You run on ahead.
Gawain and I will catch up.
Did you see that?
You'd think our new Master was injured saving me.
Let me see that leg.
I can fight my own battles!
This isn't just your fight!
Now, I understand your anger,
but do you know what revenge will do for you?
Nothing. Neither glory nor an end to your pain.
What do you know about my pain?
Boy, wait!
Now, you lost the woman who would have been your wife.
I lost the man who might as well have been my father.
That's his horse, the one we're looking for!
He's here!
Then we wait for Tancrede and Gawain.
Yeah, well, if we wait, they might get away.
I know a way in. I know the monks!
Parsifal, wait!
What are you doing here, lad?
I'm looking for the bastard who shoots a whale crossbow.
Right place.
Too bad you'll never get to meet him.
And that's why I told you to wait.
I was too young to know what love was.
I remember. You were... 12?
11.
Holiness, Isabella deserves what I could never have...
A marriage of love.
The English match would bring her only misery.
Believe me, I know.
If you have felt misery,
consider what that misery has made you...
The woman you are now.
A Queen, radiant and strong.
A leader of people.
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm not strong.
I'm weak.
I sin.
I sin with...
Shh. Enough.
Don't fret.
You'll get what you want.
Et ego te absolve a peccatis tuis
in nominee Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
And, Joan, please.
Don't talk like that again, not even in confession.
Love, in your position... It must not be spoken of.
My lady.
Forgive me.
Have you come to confess your sins?
No, most Holy One. That could take all year.
The King wishes to know
whether you'll be ready at this evening's banquet
to announce Isabella's future husband.
I was about to pray for guidance on that very matter.
Well, I did offer my services.
The Lord, or De Nogaret?
Let's see...
You don't have to be God Almighty
to know where your interests lie.
My interests are purely
what's best for Princess Isabella.
Your honeyed words may impress the pious,
but please don't insult my intelligence.
We both know joining Catalonia with France
would benefit you.
Consolidate your power, your... Holy Empire.
Of course.
Any Pope would favor a continent
united under the one true God.
But a marriage is between three people...
The husband, the wife, and the Lord.
And it is not for a man like me,
and certainly not for a man like you to intervene.
So you do favor Catalonia?
I said nothing of the kind.
And yet, the eloquence with which you say that nothing.
- Where's the knight? - What knight?
The dead knight!
Downstairs.
Why did you take his body?
I was just following orders.
Whose orders?
His name's Roland.
It's him with the crossbow.
And you were there when that bastard killed my Marie?
I told him to leave her be, but he said no witnesses.
I couldn't stop him!
That's the truth.
On my life, I swear it!
Where's Roland now?
I don't know.
Liar!
Well, now he can't tell you where Roland is.
Come on.
We'll find him.
But from now on, you do as I say.
You understand?
- Yes. - Good.
Hear you're having a party.
Can anyone come, or do you have to be the Pope?
I was rather hoping the Pope wouldn't make it.
The Pope?
He'll be meeting the people on the street before he comes.
Glad-handing the lost and incredulous.
I thought you might take the opportunity to "kiss his ring."
No.
That's too dangerous.
Danger has its compensations.
- What like? - There is a house...
There is a house by the lake at La Riche.
I wanted it for myself.
- A house? - Do this for me,
and it will be yours.
I'd never be able to work again.
I'd need more than a house.
I'd need a pension.
I thought you would say that.
This purse, twelve times a year,
and my protection for as long as you live.
Provided that the Pope does not make it to the Palace.
Let's get this out of the way.
Roland wants the body prepped.
- What are they doing to him? - That's desecration.
- Do we want to wait for Roland? - No.
He's upstairs writing love letters with the Abbot.
Just get on with it.
Parsifal!
No, he's upstairs!
You Templars haven't dirtied your pretty dresses
for 15 years.
These men taste blood every week.
Well, maybe they're not as thirsty for it as I am.
Pick him apart, lads.
- He's mine! - Pick him apart!
Read it.
"I have the Templar's body.
I will carry out the procedure and meet as planned.
Signed, 4."
Thank you.
Send it quick.
He's waiting to hear.
Thank you for your assistance, Father Abbot.
You bastard!
Should have stayed on the farm, boy.
No witnesses.
Parsifal, isn't it?
You know how I know?
Because she called your name.
"Parsifal! Parsifal!"
Let me tell you something about your girl, Parsi,
I've had sweeter, but I haven't had better.
Landry!
Oh, it's about time.
Keep it tight!
Tighter! Tighter! Together!
Gawain!
- Come on. Let me help you. - No!
Come on, lad. There's nobody left.
Come on.
He raped her, so I killed him.
I know.
It's time to go.
Am I disturbing you, Uncle?
You don't have to be so meek.
You've always been Uncle.
You're a woman now.
You understand that.
My father does not.
You saw it yourself, he treats me like a child.
He's...
Can I ask you something?
You know some men can be kind one moment,
and the next, you see another side to them...
Well, what if Prince Lluis is like that, too?
He seems so loving in his letters, but...
Every man has two sides.
The man he wants to be,
and the man he really is.
Even a man who knows himself well,
who knows his own dark thoughts,
can surprise himself with what he's capable of.
I don't want to marry a man like that.
Whoever you marry, I will see to it
that you are one of Europe's most powerful queens.
No man will dare mistreat you.
Thank you.
Don't laugh, but when I was a girl,
I used to dream of being your wife.
Your Grace is most wise.
This banquet, these distractions
will allow the losing representatives to save face.
If His Holiness ever appears to render his decision.
You gave him the invitation?
Personally.
Then where is he?
Perhaps we should send someone to find him.
I'm a little concerned.
It's not like the Pope to be late.
His Holiness, Pope Boniface!
Forgive my tardiness, Your Grace, my lady.
God's will be done.
My dear Oxford,
I know I speak for the King when I say
that it has been a great honor to have the English
as our guests in Paris.
But, by the Grace of God,
and in humble articulation of His will through me
as His servant and Christ's Vicar on Earth,
I have decided that the Princess
will marry...
Prince Lluis of Catalonia.
And so it shall be!
To express our joy and gratitude on this day,
Queen Elena and her family would like to give a small token
of their enduring allegiance of love.
Mother, thank you so much for this engagement!
I'm the luckiest person in the world!
I'm glad you got your wish!
She's as happy as I've ever seen her.
I remember you could be giddy like that at her age.
You made our daughter very happy today.
I hope I made you happy, as well.
Will you join me in my chamber?
I appreciate the invitation,
but tonight, I will take a mother's liberty
and begin the wedding preparations with our daughter.
I know that over the years
the weight of the crown has made my mood...
sour sometimes.
You've felt that, and I am sorry,
but please, tell me there's hope for us.
Of course.
You're my husband.
And my King.
No visitors, Nicholas.
I am indisposed until further notice.
But, sir, the ambassador...
Counselor, I didn't want you to think
that we had forgotten you.
I appreciate that Catalonia
was not the union you were hoping for.
But I hope this token will remind you
that Catalonia can be a powerful ally.
Open the gates!
You can sleep here tonight.
Thank you. I'll be gone by the morning.
And where will you go?
Do you have family?
Marie was my family.
Maybe it's time you found a new home.
A new family.
Join us.
Join the Templars.
Me? I'm... I'm not fit to wear the cross.
You saw what I did today.
You wanted revenge.
No one's going to blame you for that.
Yeah, and you were right...
I don't feel any better,
and it didn't bring her back.
Roland is still alive.
She's still dead.
For a man of Faith,
we believe that death is not the end.
It's a passing.
And when it's your turn,
she'll be there waiting for you on the other side.
But until then,
there's a place for you here with us if you want it.
Get some sleep.
How is the lad?
He'll survive.
It's you I'm worried about.
Me? Why?
Do I need to say it, brother?
If it's about today's combat,
my leg was a little stiff, nothing more.
Next time, I'll be careful...
There won't be a next time.
I can still fight.
Your leg has become a hindrance,
and so have you.
Gawain, you know it's true.
So that's it?
Put the Temple's finest swordsman out to pasture?
No. No.
Who better than the Temple's finest swordsman
to train the initiates?
What?
You want me to train children?
Future knights.
Damn you, Landry.
As Temple Master,
I have a responsibility to all our brothers.
If you cannot hold your own...
I hurt my leg protecting you!
Have you forgotten?
How can I forget?
You never stop reminding me!
Look, I'll always be grateful.
And I'll always be sorry
I didn't let you die on the docks at Acre.
The Siege of Damascus.
See the little figure behind the knight's shield,
playing the flute?
Imagine making music
surrounded by all that mayhem.
Marvelous, isn't it?
Some would say they see
merely the senseless slaughter of thousands
in the name of God.
Careful, De Nogaret,
that sounds dangerously close to heresy.
We live in dangerous times.
I received a most interesting present
from the Catalan Ambassador.
Olives?
No.
A man's head in a box.
How dreadful.
I'll pray for his soul.
I've always condemned such violence,
even towards one who wanted to kill me.
Why should anyone want to kill you?
Some see me as a threat towards their own machinations.
Are you a threat?
To those who would act against God and his church,
yes, I could be considered a fearsome enemy.
- Why did you really come to Paris?  - Excuse me?
I know you say that you came to mourn Godfrey,
but Templars die all over Europe.
I don't see you paying respects to all of them.
The King and Queen wanted...
The King and Queen sought your counsel
after they heard you had arrived in Paris.
Wicked men always see wickedness in others.
Yes.
I am a wicked man,
but I serve the King and France.
And I believe you are dangerous to both.
One way or the other, I will find out the truth.
Watch it.
Ooh. Hello.
Where are you off to at this hour?
I need to attend something in the city.
Well, it will have to wait.
Draper's calling. It's about Godfrey.
Tell him I need to think.
Whatever it is, it can wait till morning.
I always thought that I would serve Godfrey
and then follow in his footsteps.
Now, I never thought that was something you wanted.
I'm still not sure it is.
But it is my duty.
When I said you were making a mistake earlier...
You've always been headstrong.
You're preaching, brother.
No, I've been thinking.
Perhaps "headstrong"
is what we're going to need in the time to come.
Master.
I'll tell Draper that you can't see him
until the morning.
No.
If a brother's calling, I should answer.
Brother Gawain.
No.
I would never have expected to see a Templar in here.
Hm. Thank you.
Don't your vows forbid drinking in a public place?
Let me worry about my vows.
Despite the King's fondness for your new Master,
I've always believed you were the true hero of Acre.
Your bravery during that tragic loss
echoes throughout the Palace halls.
That's all in the past.
Heroism should never be forgotten.
I suppose.
Perhaps your brothers
do not always appreciate that.
Perhaps you should find someone who does.
There is a place
for the bravest and most heroic Templar
within the King's guard.
We have armies, but no generals of your stature.
I don't want armies or stature.
What do you want?
To be the man I once was.
Then let me help you.
The King has the finest doctors in all the land.
And in return?
Occasionally, I may need some information.
I would never tell you anything
that would hurt a brother.
Of course, nor would I ask you to.
But tell me something about the Pope.
He's in Paris for an undisclosed reason.
I know that.
Just tell me what it is.
Only say the word, and you shall be healed.
I have examined everything we had...
His clothing, inside and out, his belt, his boots.
Nothing.
Perhaps that is why the highwaymen
wanted to cut him open.
In the Holy Land, in the face of the enemy,
Crusaders were known to swallow messages, codes...
- We must check inside him. - No.
Because then we are no better than them.
Can we not leave him in peace?
If there is something there,
we can be sure that Godfrey wanted us to find it.
What do you know about the Holy Grail?
A key?
