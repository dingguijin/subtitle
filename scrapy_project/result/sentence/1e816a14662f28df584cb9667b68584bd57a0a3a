You'd Know What to Do
Master, the Sultan's emissaries offered a parley.
Allah, I ask you for the good of it
and seek refuge in You against its evil.
Our prayer when the wind blows.
Well, your God is not listening.
Is yours?
You've lost Jerusalem.
You've lost every Templar stronghold in the Holy Land,
and now you will lose the Grail.
We have 100,000 men and more coming.
We have the forces of Egypt and Syria.
We have siege-engines.
And we have God on our side.
God.
Rashid.
We have the people of Acre in our care.
Not just Christians.
Jews, Saracens... All faiths.
Tell the Sultan, they at least must be granted safe...
Sultan is no longer listening.
He will have your humiliation.
And he will have the Grail.
Surrender.
Die.
Those are your choices.
Then it's die.
Double the guard on the Grail.
Tancrede, Gawain, left troop.
Left troop.
Landry, with me on the right.
Three columns, advancing fast.
- How many? - 5,000. 10,000.
No matter how many,
cut them down all day if we have to.
Nearly 200 years ago,
nine knights founded our order
to protect pilgrims on the road to Jerusalem.
Today, Acre is our stronghold in the Holy Land,
and we will never relinquish it.
We fight for more than just this city,
more than just the men and women
who will die if it falls.
Today, we fight for the Grail.
Take every life you must take, but no more,
and remember that we answer to God
just as we fight for God.
And we win by the Grace of God.
By the Grace of God!
Ready?
Line. Will.
Attack!
First formation.
Turn back! Finish them!
Charge!
- Tancrede! On your left. - Behind you.
Godfrey! Behind you!
Landry!
Landry, get the Grail!
We're not gonna stay and fight?
There are too many of them!
We must make sure the Grail is safe!
What about Acre?
All is lost!
We meet at the docks!
Get the Grail! Now!
Yes!
Open the tomb. We're taking the Grail.
Landry, the Mamluks are at the docks.
- Already? They can't be! - We've been betrayed.
- How? - The tunnels.
It's the only way they could have made it there.
We have to go.
Fetch the gold!
Fight to the death!
Ready.
Landry! We have to get to the ship!
Help!
Papa, help! Help me!
Landry, what are you doing?
Don't wait! Get the Grail on the ship!
The box is secure.
- Cast off! - No, wait!
Landry!
Adelina!
Come!
Come.
We must go!
Get the Grail to safety.
Go.
Go! Go!
Go!
Gawain!
Gawain, do you remember the smell
of your mother's hair?
Come on.
Adelina!
Go! Go!
Go! Go!
Thank you, brother.
You would have done the same thing for me, Landry.
Acre. All the people we have failed.
- It is my fault. - No, we were betrayed.
How did they get to the docks?
We will gather more men.
We'll return and retake the Holy Land.
The Grail!
Lord, no.
It is lost.
Everything is lost.
What are you doing here?
Teaching a fool how to lose his sword.
You're the fool.
You weren't prepared.
Higher! Your arm!
Balance.
It is high.
Higher, otherwise...
Every time.
But much improvement.
Not that much.
The only possible explanation
is my teacher has no skill to pass on.
No skill?
Philip, try this.
Then it must be that you do not have the loyalty
to apply yourself to training me well.
No loyalty to the King of France.
- That would be treason. - Exactly.
You are a traitor to the crown!
Your Grace.
Landry is here.
- We are training. - Yes, but...
Affairs of state. You understand.
Stay longer next time.
Help me give some cheer to the Queen.
She is forever in her bed.
Landry.
De Nogaret.
Why do you interrupt me when I'm with my friend?
Are the Templars truly our friends?
Of course.
They're loyal to me and to France.
You worry too much, De Nogaret.
If you wish to worry about something,
worry about Flanders, England.
Worries like that cost money.
And yet, the Templars, our friends,
rich beyond reason, no longer come to our aid.
It is not the job of the Templars
to put money in our coffers, De Nogaret.
It is yours.
Find another way.
We could take money from the Jews.
The Jews will not lend to us.
You said so yourself.
Not lend.
Take?
No.
No, I'm not that kind of king.
I told you... I want to be loved by the people.
Make way there.
And let me tell you this about the Jews...
They will take your babies.
It's true.
They take good Christian babies
and they crucify them to mock Jesus!
Good boy.
Behave yourself, brother.
What?
I'll give you "What?" I saw you looking.
Vows of chastity. Remember those?
Looking is not touching.
No, but it's the first step. Trust me.
Come on. We have a meeting.
Don't hurry.
We all have to wait for you.
I was with the King.
Brothers.
Lord, bless us.
Bless Jacques, our Grand Master.
Bless Boniface, our Pope.
And grant us all Thy wisdom.
- Amen. - Amen.
Brother Tancrede.
Thank you, Master Godfrey.
Our expenditure is still high at 9,000 each month.
And what of our loans?
Repayment in good time from Benedict of Artois,
income in the form of rents
received from his lands, as agreed.
The De Caux estate is in arrears, as ever,
and of course, there are no repayments from the King.
While you were at the palace with your friend,
perhaps you should have reminded him.
The King is happy enough to take our money,
but not to pay it back.
Well, at least he's doing something with it.
What are we doing?
We're having meetings about loans.
We feed the poor.
We help with shelters.
Any monk can feed the poor.
We are Templars! We are warriors.
We're supposed to fight for the Holy Land.
Safe passage for pilgrims.
Instead, we dole out a few loaves of bread
so nobody notices we're hoarding our wealth.
We ignore the treatment of the Jews
in our own city as if somehow we are not respon...
The Jews are not our problem.
Well, then, whose problem are they,
if not ours?
You know the Templar mandate...
In London, in Rome, in Naples, Paris...
Wherever we are...
We do not get involved in city affairs.
Well, then, what do we do?
What are we for?
Brother Landry.
I understand your frustration.
It's been 15 years!
15 years since we lost Acre,
and I don't understand why!
Why are we still in Paris? What are we waiting for?
Are we waiting for the Holy Land to come back by itself?
Landry. Now is not the time.
The Sultans are fighting amongst themselves.
The Mongols are attacking them from the East.
If we act now, we can retake the Holy Land.
We have the money.
We still have thousands of men across Europe.
Now is the time.
It's not for us to decide.
It is for God to decide.
I love you, Godfrey, but God has forgotten us.
He abandoned us in Acre.
Trust me.
I want to explain things to you,
but the wind, Landry.
The wind is still against us.
I have to go.
What?
It's nothing.
It's something outside the city.
Godfrey, what's the matter?
Prepare my horse immediately.
Prepare mine, too.
- I'm coming with you. - No. I won't be long.
In my absence, you're in charge.
I want you to be Master.
- Godfrey. - One thing...
You're right.
We must protect the Jews.
Gawain tells me you're in charge
while the old man is away.
I'm worried about him.
He's not himself.
There's something wrong, believe me.
And there's this...
I found it in the cloister.
I think he saw it, and that's why he left suddenly.
It means something.
Trust me, brother, you're thinking too much.
I'll see you at Compline.
Going somewhere in a hurry, Master Templar?
How about Daniel?
Or George! I'd love a George.
A good solid worker for the farm.
If my father hears you talking of children before we marry,
he'll nail your crickets to the nearest tree.
What? Crickets? You call them crickets?
Parsifal, get back to work.
I'd like a Matthew and a Paul, too.
Four boys?! And not one girl?
Yeah, well, girls are trouble.
What is it?
A Templar knight.
Highwaymen.
Get inside.
- Oh, what about you? - Marie, go!
What do you want from me?
Talk and we'll make it painless.
Don't waste your time.
Templars enjoy pain.
They think it brings them closer to God.
Isn't that right, Godfrey?
You better run!
Run away, lad!
Run!
You should have listened, lad!
What about you?
You like pain?
You were lucky.
Next time, be more careful on the road, old man.
Next time, bring more men.
You did well.
My name is Godfrey.
Parsifal. Sir.
Marie, bring water and something for a bandage!
No. Too late.
My sword.
Where is it?
I'm going to ask you to do something.
You have no idea how important it is.
Anything.
Take this sword to the Templars in Paris.
Paris? I can't go to Paris.
I'm just a farmer.
Find a knight named Landry there.
Give him the sword
And tell him he'll know what to do.
God's Kingdom depends on it.
- You've never even left the village! - Well, not true.
- I went once with a woodcutter. - You were 11!
Parsifal, please don't leave!
Marie, you heard him.
I have to.
Rose.
What?
That's what we'll call our daughter.
Rose.
Forgive me, Madam.
I followed you here.
I couldn't help noticing you on the street.
Something...
Something about your eyes.
Your fine face.
Your fine legs.
Your even finer...
Be quiet.
Madam, I'm a lonely warrior in need of love.
You were not so lonely earlier today
that you did not leave me in the street,
wanting...
Wanting?
Wanting what?
Don't make me say it.
Say it.
I like it.
Wanting you.
There was a meeting.
There is always a meeting.
True.
I'm not a warrior. I'm an attender of meetings.
It's a curse.
Mend my troubled soul.
You're neither of those things.
You're a monk.
You should not be here.
I'm here.
Yes, you are very much here.
I missed you.
Joan, I missed you, too.
I love this.
I love everything, but I love this.
Where the belly joins onto the hip.
I know.
What man in his right mind
would turn his back on this?
To know this place on a woman.
Stop it.
Something happened today.
Godfrey suddenly left the city. I don't know why.
There's something he isn't telling me.
And?
I'm worried about him. He's my Master.
He's more than that.
He's like a father to you.
But if he's my father, I'm not a very good son.
He's left me in charge of the Temple,
and I repay his trust with this.
Do you regret your time with me?
No.
You're the only woman I've ever loved.
And you know they have those noses, the Jews?
Their noses are so big!
Do you know why?
Because the air is free!
What have we got here?
Shalom, my friend.
Shalom.
Where's the man who carries this sword?
Godfrey, he, um...
How?
Highwaymen. They chased him, shot his horse.
Godfrey killed them all.
Only their leader got away.
- Where's his body? - At my house.
My fiancÈe and her father will have buried him properly.
No. He should be laid to rest here in the Temple,
after the funeral he deserves.
Take some initiates.
Bring him home.
What will you do now?
What do you mean?
He said take the sword to you.
He said you would know what to do.
Come on.
Boy...
Thank you.
"You'd know what to do?"
What does that mean?
I don't know.
Make sure his sword is cleaned
and kept in his office.
We'll bury it with his body.
And send word to the Pope. He'll want to know.
- Brother Landry. - No! Not now!
Forgive me, sir, but I thought you'd want to know,
there's been a murder in the city.
A Jew killed a Christian.
The people want revenge.
The Queen and I were married in this church.
It holds a special place in my heart.
She was just a girl then.
How she has flowered.
You should marry, De Nogaret.
Sometimes the object of a man's desire
is... beyond reach.
Besides, I'm already married to France.
And your service.
- Your Grace, regarding the Jews... - We settled that.
There has been a development.
A Christian trader has been killed in the market square.
A Jew stabbed him in broad daylight.
Then this Jew must be punished in the usual way.
I'm afraid matters have gone beyond that.
The murderer escaped and hides among his own.
The people are so angry.
They will not stop until every Jew in Paris is dead.
The Queen believes we need the Jews,
and I share her opinion.
Their doctors heal our sick, their merchants...
I agree with Her Grace.
The Jews should be protected.
But I'm afraid the only way to protect them
is an evacuation.
A forced evacuation?
For the greater good and for their own safety.
It is the only way.
Hello, De Nogaret.
Reynard, thank you for coming.
I've done the job.
Did you hear the news?
- Are you happy? - Yes. Well done.
It appears your performance was most convincing.
The King has ordered the expulsion of the Jews.
You're welcome.
Let them leave the city in peace.
Once they're on the open road, round them up,
take all their money, and kill them.
Need a lot of men. Fair cost to it.
You'll be paid.
What about the children?
Leave them be?
Why?
We need to get Godfrey's body before dark.
Let's get back on the road.
Were you wounded in the Holy Land?
Well, I meant no offense, but I see your leg.
Yes. I was wounded at Acre.
Why would you do that?
Travel 1,000 miles to fight in a strange land?
If you do not understand, then I cannot explain.
What you see as a wound, I see as a gift.
Yeah, well, a wound like that
would be no gift on a farm, I can tell you.
Anything else you want to tell me?
No.
Let's go.
Make way for the royal chamberlain!
Stand back! Out of the way!
- Move aside! - Step aside!
- Get back! - Keep it clear!
By the order of the King,
the Jewish Quarter is to be cleared.
Aah!
What about the children?
All men, women, and children of the Jewish faith
are required to leave the city by the vespers bell.
Listen! The King must be heard!
Listen to me!
It is done in the interest of peace
and for your own protection!
The King guarantees every person safe passage.
They're all going to be slaughtered.
We can't raise arms.
Legally, we have no mandate.
Godfrey knew the limits of our jurisdiction, Tancrede,
but he still charged me with protecting the Jews.
Even so, this is dangerous.
Our order was founded on the principle of
- protecting pilgrims on the road. - Tell me something.
How did you come to hear of this supposed slaughter?
I can't say.
Well, if you can't say, we can't act.
Believe me, brother,
it comes from a trusted source.
I don't doubt your word, Landry,
but if I'm to agree on an intervention...
Brother, as acting Master,
I wasn't aware that we had to agree on anything.
Well, might I advise the acting Master
to consider this decision carefully?
If your first order sends Templars
into an illegitimate battle,
it could also be your last.
Nothing. Keep going!
Step aside!
If we had fought, then what?
If we'd fought and we'd won,
would we suddenly be welcomed back in Paris?
- That's not the point. - It is the point.
We were not welcome. We were not safe.
My job as your father is to keep you safe.
Safe. I don't want to be safe.
I want to be...
- Jews. - There's the Jews.
- Yeah! - Look at them!
There they are!
Papa! Papa!
Halt!
- Form! - Ready!
Formation!
Arms!
Charge!
Take them down!
Adelina!
Aah!
Brother, let me help you.
Thank you for your help.
It was very brave of you.
You saved us once before.
At Acre.
I remember.
You take this.
You show this document at any Templar house
on your journey.
You and your people will be fed.
I don't know what to say.
And may your God bless you.
Come.
Thank you, but we will retrieve our Master's body
and return to Paris.
Yeah, well, even if I would allow you to go home unfed,
Marie would not.
No. No!
No!
Marie! Marie!
Your Grace.
You are lucky.
I am good spirits.
The Queen is in better health, and tonight, we dine with the nobles.
Your Grace?
The Jews were set-upon on the road.
So I gather.
Most unfortunate.
You think I am weak?
Your Grace?
I am many things, De Nogaret,
but I am not weak.
Your Grace.
If I find out you disobeyed me,
by God, I shall see you hanged from Montfaucon.
Am I understood?
His Grace, King Philip, and Her Grace Queen Joan.
Godfrey sent us a message!
- What message? - Come.
Is that...
The Grail.
Is that the Fleur-de-lis?
Yes. That's France.
The Holy Grail is in France.
