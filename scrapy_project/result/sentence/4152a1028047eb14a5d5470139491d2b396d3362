Damn it!This is impossible!We have to try and go back up, Alex.Find another way around this.Look, I can't go up, can I?There has to be a way down.No. We just gotta go backand find another way.I think if we follow this path...Alex, we're not doing that.We follow that path, and we... and we die.The last time you thoughtyou knew something, we ended up...What do you mean, the last time I thought?The last time I thought,I was trusting my instincts, you know.- Alex.

I'm scared.Admit that you're scared, too.Ben...do you actually knowwhat it means to be reckless?It means to abandon safety.- I know exactly what it means, Alex.- And sometimes...- But right now...- Right now, we don't have a choice, okay?Nobody knows where we are.You know, all we have is me and you.That is it, Ben.I don't want to die! Okay?Tell me, Doctor, from your heart.Do you a... Do you actually thinkwe're gonna make it?No.My instinct tells methat we're gonna die up here.But we do have a choice.And we're still alive.Here we go.

I'm sorry.We're not gonna die.Not today.Shit.Where are we going?We're alive.That's where we're going.We've been walking for three days.We haven't found anything.Let's hope this valley leads us there.Can we stop?
