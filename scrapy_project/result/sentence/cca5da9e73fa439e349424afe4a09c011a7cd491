- There's a time when theoperation of the machinebecomes so odious,makes you so sick at heartthat you can't take part.You can't evenpassively take part,and you've got to putyour bodies upon the gearsand upon the wheels,upon the levers,upon all the apparatus,and you've got to make it stop!♪- First, let me start bysaying Mario Savio's"Operation of the Machine"is one of my favoritespeeches of all time.Mario wasn't a politicianor some famous Hollywood star.He was just a studentwho was for civil rights.He stood on a car at Berkleyand screamed whatevercame into his head.He didn't care that he hada stuttering problemor that he might get thrownout of school, which he did.He just wantedhis voice to be heardand be unencumberedby the machine.As an investigativewriter that has yetto be officially published,I can relate to Mario's desire.That's me behind the wheel,Jay Bahadur, proud collegegraduate of the class of 2007,arguably the worst yearsince the Great Depressionto graduate school,but timing wasnever my strength.In fact, good timing seems to beat odds with my very existence,but like manyunpleasantries in life,you just learn to deal with it.- Afternoon, shoppers--- Yo.Hey, man. Is Mark Reiss here?- Reissy? Oh, he left.- Shit, really?- Yeah.- Damn it,he was supposed to be here.- It's kind of lousy out,if you didn't notice.He left early. Are youinterviewing for stock boy or--- Me? No.My name is Jay Bahadur.I'm doing market researchon premium napkins.Mind if I ask youa few questions?- Your name isn't even on here.- I assure you, I am legit.- You drove all the wayfrom Torontoto ask questions about napkins?- Premium napkins.- Thought my job sucked.- Could you show yourpaper product aisle?- But I'm just kind of busy.- Is there a reason why the six--reason why the six packThis thing does not like me.Is there a reason whythe six pack paisley napkinsare here and not here?It's not a trick question.- I--I think because it was justeasier putting them on the floorthan on the top shelf.- And would making our packagingmore festive make you considermoving the premium napkinsto the top shelf?You're probably thinkingthat a personwith my intellectual capacitywould loathe waiting forthat gentleman's answerto my question.But actually,I feel quite the contrary.- I would just leave themon the bottom shelf, man.It's less work.- Less work.Understanding what drives a mindto react the wayit does to thingsnever ceases to amaze me.My careful documentation of thisone man's opinion could,in its own way,reshape the patterns of napkinson every home on this street,including that one,my ex-high school girlfriend,Tracy Zicconi's house.The darkened second-floorwindow just a reminderthat she now resides1,825 miles away at Stanford.And I know it's 1,825 miles awaybecause I have an obsessionwith Google Maps,not with my ex-highschool girlfriend.I was raised as a non-practicingHindu-Christianhalf-Indian livingat this address.This is the home of Kailashand Maria Bahadur.My well-laid-out graduation planwas only to visit my formerresidence on festive holidayssuch as CanadianThanksgiving and Christmas,perhaps offering my skills atturkey basting or tree trimming,but this was 2008.Plans evaporated.Upon my graduation from theesteemed University of Toronto,my parents had decidedto give me my own mailbox.They saw it as a way in whichto somehow legitimizemy residence in their basement.The funny thing wasthat the mailmanrefused to delivermy mail there,so Mom would sort the mailand deliver it herselfafter each delivery."Dear Mr. Bahadur,the editorial staff"at 'Vanity Fair' has reviewedyour story submission,"and we unfortunately do notfeel"it's something we would likeour magazine"to pursue at this time.We wish you the best of luckat other publications--"Blah fucking blah.Why do all rejection lettershave the word "unfortunately"in the first sentence?Surely there is a more originaladverb to toss in there.I vow that I will neverwrite for a publicationthat uses the word"unfortunately"in their first sentence.I am better than that.Come on.Jared? Jared?Jared.Is that my Red Bull?- No.- Look at me.- Mom says you got to shovelthe snow in the drivewayso Dad can get in.- Me?- Mm-hmm.- You're not doing anything.- Doing homework.- Uh, where's mom?- The elusive pinkfairy armadillohas been known to--- Mom?

Tracy is repulsedby older men.- You were older.- Two years is not older, man!- It's a little bit older.- Fuck you, Crowe.- Hey, are you sure you don'twant to hit Parrots with us?- No, dude, I got to--- Do some shit nobodygives a fuck about?- Exactly.- All right, well,that is your loss,but if you change your mind,please hit us up.- You got it.

That's me.- Holy fuck.You are one of my favoritejournalists of all time.- Come on. You Facebook peoplehave favorite journalists?- You were one of thefirst reporters who had the gutsto report the Battle ofOng Thanh as a loss.- That's--So you're a journalist?- No. Well, I mean, yeah,I want to be,but I can't--I just--you know,I haven't taken a--I never took a class,but I'm seriously--I'm thinkingabout going backto get a degree.Harvard is the--is the goal.- Oh, how can you saysomething stupid like that?- What--- Why do you think journalismis a pile of "People" magazine,"She got cellulite on herDumpster" crap right now?Journalism isn't taught.It's innate.You know what I'm saying?You think the shrapnelin my back landed therebecause I was using my head?No way.- So what are you saying?- I'm saying fuck Harvard,is what I'm saying.Fuck Harvard.You want to make it as some bigswinging dick journalist?You got to go somewherefucking crazy.- Somewhere where Westernreporters would considerit too dangerous to go,like, write as a stringerfrom there, get a book going.It's the only way out.- Yeah, that makes sense, man.That makes sense.Where you thinking of going?- Somalia.Hmm?- Like, I--I bought a--An umbrella from a Somali once.- What does that mean?- That means where'sthe fucking conflict,besides the fact that theymachete reporters to death?- In Somalia the seedsof democracyare growing amidst anarchy.I did a paper on itmy freshman year.- So?- So it's a misunderstood place.- Bro, democracy is not topical,all right?No--nobody wantsto understand Somalia.- Did you know in Somalilandthey held an electionwhere the minority clan won thepresidential office by 80 votes,and there was no violence?The transition of powerwas peaceful.- It was peaceful because nobodybothered reporting on it.You need to listen to me.You want conflict?You want to tell the storyfrom both sides?Go to Sudan.There's your ticket,not Somalia.- I don't know, man.

That's what I'm tryingto tell you--- Stop! Try again.You got a book outline?- I'm formulating it.- I knew you'd get iton the third try.Come on, let's go.So how much do you knowabout Somalia?- Uh, well, I did a term paperon it my freshman yearat university, so.- That's good.Don't tell me the grade.It's a start.Immerse yourself in it.You dig cigars?- I never understood cigars.- That's clever,don't you think, Jo?Okay.

Thank you.- Yes, yes.- Yeah.Your English is great.- It's not perfect.I try to learn from youduring your stay, Mr. Bahadur.- Oh, please call me Jay.- Jay?- Yeah, Jay.- Jay, you have one bag?- Yeah, one bag.- Oh, you're like Obama,a man that knows what he wants.- You know Obama?- Of course. He will be greatleader for your people.- Oh, I'm Canadian.He's--he's not my leader.- Of course he is.Your people just don't know it.Come.♪♪So I hear you arean author and journalist.- Yes.- Good, good.There is so much to writeabout in this country.What is your subject?- In a perfect worldI'd be writingabout your newfound democracy,but, um, given the factthat the West has broken offall relations with you, um,I'm here to writeabout your pirates.- You mean badaadinta badah?- Bada-binda-bada? What is that?- It means saviors of the sea.They are like Coast Guard.You can never call them pirates.- Okay. That's good to know.- They have very strong opinionon this, never pirates.- Are they easy to find?- Yes, of course.They are peoplewith crazy money.- So they walk freely?- Yes, but our newPresident Farolehas promised to change this.He is a very tough manwho will bring much change.Ah!- Is everything okay?- Yes, yes.It's okay?- Yes, yes.Sometimes I feel like fatherwith little children.They need khat.- Khat.- Yes. We must stop up here.- In Somalia one hourand already shootingmy first drug deal,my kind of country.So khat is a drug?- Yes, it's--it's a stimulantleaf from Kenya and Ethiopia.It's very addictive,big problem here.What's he saying?- He wants to knowif you want to buy some.- Oh, no, I--I--sorry,I'm on a very fixed budget.I didn't account for drugmoney. I don't have any--He wants you to try it.- It won't kill you.Yes, just bite down.- What's the effects?- Makes some peoplewant to have sex,others very talkative.- Ugh! Tracy was a great girl,but, you know, she--what--whatare you gonna do?She moves on. I move on.I really doubt we'll evereven talk again.I mean, why bother, right?Seems like a waste of time.I mean, it's just gonnaconfuse thing and make itmore difficult.- Men and womencan't be friends.- Exactly!Exactly, that'sthe same over here?- Yes, it's a universal thought.- See, where I comefrom, they debate it.They debate it likemorons, like idiots.- It's not a debate. It's fact.We're reaching a checkpoint.Please stay calm.- Ah, Mr. Bahadur..- Hi.- So we finally meetface to face, huh?- Yes, nice to meet you.- Nice to meet you, sir. Abdi.You are younger thanI pictured, somewhat.- Ah.- Western reporters to meare always so fucking unhappy.- Well, I get even betteronce I shower.- Come on, come on.Has Abdi been good to you?- Yes, mad good, yeah.- He's the best translatorin all of Puntland, you know?- Oh, no, really?- Yeah.We stole him from the pirates.- Oh, you mean, uh,badaadinta badah?- Abdi, did you teach him this?- Ah--- This is notour Coast Guard, Abdi,they are pirates!You must forgetthe old guard's thinking.They are pirates!- Pirates.- Mr. Jay.- Hi.- So what do you think ofthe Radio Garowe newsroom?- Nice.- Does it look likethe ones in Canada?- Yes.Yes, it does, a bit, yeah.- It's amazing, huh?- Is it a local station or, um--- Oh, one minute.- Okay.
