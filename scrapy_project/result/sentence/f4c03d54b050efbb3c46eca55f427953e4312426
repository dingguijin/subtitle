Why are you lying?Why? Oleg, she's lying.Her EKG is better than mine.Listen. You are not a doctor.He's a doctor.I'd donate you to science withthose weird symptoms of yours.I have heart attacks every day.Okay.Did the shot work this time?Feeling any better?I think I am...Not sure.Come on. Send her to a district doctor.I'm ready to go to hospital.I have everything packed.You won't be admitted. Trust me.Okay, then. Get dressed.But first, you'll have to sign a paper.Your consent to recentlyintroduced regulations.And then we'll go.Fine.Here you go. Write it down.I, Valentina Nikolayevna......have read......and agree to......have my head shaved.Today's date and signature.What's that?They have introduced new sanitaryregulations for admissions offices.They shave patients' headsto prevent infection.That's nonsense!I'm not signing this!You have to.They make no exceptions.I'm not going anywhere!How are you doing, guys?We're wrapping up.Leaving in a minute.37 Radischeva St., poisoning.Got it.Oh my...I'm feeling sick.I'll probably have tocall an ambulance again.Ma'am, will you please stopcalling an ambulance?You are slackers!You are not treating me!I want them to send someone else!Maybe they'll treat me!My God!Oh, my God!You know what?I have an incredible pill, made in Germany.Ever heard of nanotechnology?Yeah, I think I did.They've invented a pillthat cures everything.I brought it for my grandma, actually.But if you're feeling this sick...Terribly sick!Here it is.You have to suck onit for two weeks.In two weeks, you'll feellike a million bucks.But you'll have to be patient.My goodness!Go ahead, put it under your tongue.Come on.That's it.You better lie down.I don't get it.Hold on. I'm in the park, right.What's around you?Do you see the bags store?Hold on. No, don't go anywhere.Right.The park is right behind me.Oleg, you are on the opposite side.I'm crossing the road.No, don't move the car.What a distrustful moron. Thatwas clear right from the start.Hi.Were you drinking?Are you gonna drive like this?What were you expecting?Come on.Well, good for you.What about him?Did he get better?No way!Come on, you are shitting me!Katya, can you pull over?I gotta take a piss.Katya, let's stop by a store, okay?Why?I'll buy a box.Can't you wait a bit?You'll drink there.Come on. I haven't beendrinking for half an hour.Is this one okay?Hey, Mom.Yeah, hi.On our way.We're on our way.Mom, what do you want me to do?We'll be there in 20 minutes.Mom, I can't talk right now. I'm driving.See you in a bit....and not once--not that I know of, at least,did our dear Mikhail Sergeevich give up.You see what I mean? That strength--Hey there!Finally they are here!Dear Katya, finally!Colleagues.I'd like to finish my toast.Sure thing. Sorry.Oleg, you may sit there.Come on, let me finish the toast.Where was I?And one might think that this personwas just born with all these talents.Just like that.But that's not true.I know how hard he had to work.He worked really hardto get where he is now.And when someone says,"It's so easy for him"--That's nonsense. That's nothow it works in our field.You can't do a sloppy job.Well, you can, but you won't last long.You will get squeezedout of this profession.In order to keep up with the highstandards, you have to see so much blood!To see so much...shit!Kids, pardon my language!I'm telling it how it is!So...To be honest, Misha, I regardyou as the best among us all.In all areas!I'm being serious right now.Thank you.Moreover...Well, Misha...I've been jealous of you for many years!Come on!Uncle Kolya has confessed!Then, I realized there wasno point in feeling jealous.One should learn from such people.One should use them as role models.Am I right?I want you all to stand up.Go ahead.Let's raise our glasses!Bottoms up!So well said!I'll have to keep the bar high.Happy birthday!Please help yourselves!Shashlik is almost ready!Katya, why did it takeyou so long to get here?Dad, I had to work.You said you were leaving at 6 pm.That's when they broughtin a stroke patient.I was the only availabledoctor at the moment.I had to take care of her.Seems like Oleg was having fun today.Dad, we were both working.So good!Pass it over.Katya, let me pour you some.Which one?I'll drink the red one.I'll drink this one, too.Although...Oleg. You hear me?How about taking a break from it?How about some tea?I don't want tea.Dad, let's drink to your health.Dad, I love you very much!I love you, too!Really glad that you came.Come on. We'd never miss it.You never know.Misha picked these mushroomshimself last year.They are really good!Oleg, take a clean one.It's okay. I'll wipe it with a napkin.Oleg.Go lie down for a minute.I'm not tired.There's a sofa in the veranda.Go rest a bit.Misha, take it easy.Leave him alone.Go lie down! You hear me?Dad, come on. That's enough.I want to help him.He's not feeling well. He should go and--Dad, you want us both to go?We will.Stop it.Go on, eat up.Katya, Mom baked a cake!Really?!Yes, I did.We should get divorced.I'm off to bed.Oleg, put something on.Katya, I say you take it all off.Put something on or I'll leave.Have you read it?I have.Why didn't you reply?I should've replied?Yeah, it would've been nice.I should have texted you back?Well, you could've reacted somehow.Katya, that's bullshit.Oleg, it's not bullshit.Getting divorced through texts is.Don't yell.They'll hear us.Let's keep it down.You're mad because I got drunk?That's not it.What, then?Why are you mad, then?Oleg, do you love me?That's a very dumb question.I do.I don't think so.Here we go with the whining.I've already made a decision.Well, good for you.Do you agree?I don't.So, you don't, and...?And what?You've already made a decision.Go ahead, get divorced.What should we do about the apartment?I'll move out tomorrow.Where are you moving out to?You won't find an apartment in one day.Let's say we move out in a week.You'll find an apartment, I will, too.You'll sleep in the kitchen for now. Okay?As you say.Let's not tell anyone.We'll tell them afterwe've separated for good.Okay?Is there an accident or something?What's the problem?Nikolayevich, turn the siren on.Dima.The siren will do jack shit.Why did you park the car like that?Well? Is that better?Let's take the waterfront.You think we'll squeezein between the trees?Tell her to go to her room.She won't listen to me.Did you sleep well last night?No, I didn't.My chest hurt, or maybe my stomach.Right here.I threw up, too.I think it's poisoning.What did you do yesterday?We went to a friend's party.There was a lot of food.Fat stuff.Did you drink?I did.Did you throw up more than once?Just once, but I'm feeling nauseous.It must be food poisoning.Marina, we got a heart attack.Take her to the Central Hospital, there'sno angiography in her local hospital.</i>Any drug allergies?No.Dima.Nitrospray under the tongue.Acetylsalicylic acid, 300.Clopidogrelum, 300.And Heparin, 5000, intravenously.I can't go to hospital, I gotno one to leave the child with.Open your mouth. Lift the tongue.Where's your phone?Got a husband?Mother? Neighbors?Here you go.Can I stay at home though?Don't take my Mommy away!Why are you crying? Come on.Stop that spectacle!Call a friend or a neighbor.You'll be back with your kid in no time.Katya, a heart attack.Tell the cardiologists to get ready.Okay, I will.And?What do you mean?You see the line is distorted?Yeah, there is an abnormality.You should check the Troponin level.Stop playing smart, weare doing it already.What's bothering you?I have a stomach ache.Troponin: negative.Well, it's like thisduring the first 6 hours.- Does it hurt?- It does.Take her to her local hospital.It's pancreatitis.What if you're wrong?Oleg, you are overdiagnosing again.You're using old cardiographs.A heart attack patient every 5 minutes.She's 30, what are you talking about?Besides, she drank alcohol. Did you?I did. It must be poisoning.Get the documents, take herto the local hospital.Our surgery ward is packed,we can't take new patients.Now you believe me?You can't be that stupid.She's got all the symptoms: EKG, pain.Katya, you should take herfor an ultrasound scan.Ultrasound scans are for emergencies only.Take the patient back to your car.What is it, then?A heart attack, but they didn'tbelieve you because you threw up.It can't be heart attack.The doctor said that'simpossible at my age.Is that true?I'm feeling better.Well, let's take a ride, then.We have plenty of time.Give her Dopamine, just in case.Heart attack, that'swhat I said right away.Why the hell did you bring her here, then?You know we don't do angiography!Make a note that you rule out pancreatitis.Wasn't that obvious?!Write the diagnosis down,stop yelling at me!We've been driving heraround town for 2 hours!Write down the diagnosis,I'll take her back.Katya.Is that lunatic around?Tatiana whatshername.Give her the phone.Come on.Katya, let me speak to her.Hello, yeah.Mironov speaking.Right.I have a question for you.How valuable is the time spent on a heartattack patient in relation to their recovery?Get the table ready,we're taking her back.There are serious complications.Try not to kill her.Magnesia, Mexidol...3 and 1.Atropine?It's all here: Atropine, Adrenaline...Right, 2 of Adrenaline.So, it's not all there.Why are you still here?I thought you left.We came back. It was nearby.Freeze!Hello, Gennady Semenovich!- What did you give her?- Who?The old woman. What did you give her?She filed two complaints.What happened?She says you gave her abanned pill from Holland.Nearly killed her.I gave her a toy gun bullet.To suck on.I thought she'd get off our backsfor a day. She'd be busy sucking.You want another fine?I got plenty.How about a bonus one?Please don't!Guys!- How are things?- All good!Girls!Is this pillow okay? It's small.It'll do just great!You could use the turtle as a pillow.No, thanks. It stinks.Wow, it's all covered in dust.Whatever.Could you close it?Check it out.Is it comfortable?Look, I can eat lying down.Would be bad if I steppedon your face at night.Need a hand with the sheet?I'll manage.Okay, I'm off to bed, then.Bye.Yes?Katya, where do we keep the tomato paste?What paste?I need a chaser.Found it!Okay, bye.Oleg, what's your problem?!Get out!Katya, I'm late for work.Don't look at me.I've seen your tits a million times.You won't ever see them again.Katya, your ass is out.Screw you!Get her passport, insurance papers,hospital certificates, if any.Things that she might need.We're taking her to a hospital.Could you explain the situation first?Intestinal bleeding. We're takingyour mother to intensive care unit.Why intensive care?She needs observation...transfusion...Blood transfusion?Please get her ready, we have to go.No, we can't...We can't do blood transfusion.You won't have to do anything.They'll find you a donor.Mom, we are not going.We refuse to go.What do I have to sign?Miss, I don't mean to scare you...But in 2 hours your mother willbe dead unless she gets help.- Let's go, darling.- Take it easy, Mom. You're not dying.We'll call our doctor.Are you out of your mind?- You are going to kill her.- No, I'm not.We can't do blood transfusion.Witnesses or something?Yes, we are.Witnesses of what?It goes against their religious beliefs.Okay, let's not waste time.Ma'am, listen to me.Margarita Ivanovna, do you hear me?I do.Do you want to be hospitalizedin order to save your life?I do.Mom, we can't do that.Go wait in the corridor.- Dima, let's use the blanket.- Sure.Guys, don't touch her,she's not going anywhere!You try that again, I'llhit you in the face.Grab her legs."Yesterday we called an ambulancefor my mother, Margarita Melikhova."I did not remember their names."The doctors were being rude, theydid not take their shoes off."They were being insolent, they were drunk.We weren't drunk."They ignored our religiousbeliefs which deeply insulted us."We refused to be hospitalizedon account of having a personal doctor"whom we were going to call."But these so-calleddoctors grabbed my mother,"nearly dropping her on the staircase,"and dragged her out againsther will, laughing.""When I made an attempt to retrieve my dearmother from these so-called doctors,"I was hit in the face."After that, the thuggishone said he'd break my nose"if I tried to approachmy dear mother again."He was swearing which insulted me as areligious person for the second time."I'm demanding their dismissalon account of incompetence."What are we gonna do?Write an explanatory note.I did push her hard.Why would you do that?That was the right thing to do.You're telling me it's all true?No, everything else is not true."...grabbed my mother, draggedher against her will..."It's not true."...didn't take their shoes off..."Well, yeah, we didn't.Write it down:The patient gave her consentto hospitalization...in a critical, life threatening condition.Let's omit the push andyour shoes, okay?We're ignoring that?We are.Do you think it'll help?I don't know. That's mylast week on the job.I'll try to take care of this.If I don't, I'm sorry.You'll have to take itto your new boss, then.No idea who he is andwhat his methods are.Oleg!Oleg, wake up!Hey, get in here.Who's that in the kitchen?He works in the trauma unit.What the hell?!Katya, go to sleep.Oleg, leave my bed now!Katya, cut it out!I'm not leaving the bed.Go to sleep.Assholes!Oleg.What the...?!Katie!Are you mad at me?Come on, what's wrong?Give me a break!I haven't gotten laid in a week.What's going on?What are you up to?Did I offend you in some way?You did not, Oleg.It feels like you livein some other galaxy.I'm tired of trying to get there.I've run out of fuel, water, food...desire!Moreover, this galaxy doesn't givea shit if I ever get there or not!It just doesn't care!Even if I get there, I don't thinkthis galaxy will even notice that.I have no idea what you are talking about.Leave the room.I want you to leave me alone.Keep your eyes open.

I'm nodding off.I can't join you. I'll go to sleep.Katya, hold on.Oleg, let's talk later, please.I'm really tired.Katya, I'm really sorry. Iwas going to wait for you...Oleg, I really don't care what happened.Are you mad at me? I'm an idiot!I'm not an idiot, I'm just drunk.You have the right tobe mad at me, I agree.Can you leave? I don't wantto talk to you right now.I'm not leaving until you forgive me.I forgive you. Are we done?I are too serious, I don'tthink you meant it.Forgive me.I forgive you.Let's go drink a quick one.- I'm really tired.- It means you didn't forgive me.I'm very tired, can't you understand that?Please leave! I forgive you!- Please don't be mad!- I'm not mad!Okay, I'm leaving. Youcan sleep all you want.You don't have to yell.- He forgot the money.- Buy some cigarettes!- Hold on!- Throw in some change to make it heavier.Do you promise to come back?♪ This summer, the clouds aregoing to be especially pretty</i>♪ Being there for you is whatleft-handers are known for</i>Did I scare you?I'm sorry.Katya, I don't remember anything.That's great.Let's talk.- Oleg, we did that yesterday.- Let's talk again, I'm begging you.- I don't remember what we were--- I'm gonna be late for work.I'm working overnight again.I'll go with you.I know why you hate me so much.I'm a good-for-nothing.I don't make a lot of moneyand it pisses you off.I'll never be able to make a lot.I'll never have a real career.Meanwhile, you will beevolving and improving.And I'll just be an emergency doctor.I make you feel ashamedbefore your parents.Probably before your colleagues, too.That's what I'm like.I'm a total failure.You hate me and I deserve that.Maybe you shouldn't be with me after all.Maybe you'll be better off...With someone who's smarter...more successful...I can't!- Calm down!- I just can't!Don't fucking touch me!Don't ever touch me again!Do you really think I'mthat fucking shallow?Katya, hold on, please.Don't you touch me!- Take it easy.- Don't touch me ever again!- Katya.- What the hell, Oleg?!Do you really see me this way?Oleg, are you that dumb?Katya, I really love you. Honest.Get out of the car.Katya, listen to me. Wait.Where are you going?!Is everyone present?Close the door, please.Thanks.Hello, everyone.My name is Vitaly Golovko. I am thenew head of this emergency station.I'm sure we'll have a chance toget to know each other better,but right now I'd like to discussour work process in general.I'm sure you are aware of constant changes in publichealth service. We have to adapt to these changes.Changes for the better?Of course, that's why I'm here.Don't worry, we'll make it allwork smoothly in no time.First thing first.I'd like to open this meeting...with my favorite rule of 20.It's as simple as that:your trip to a patient mustn'ttake more than 20 minutes;working with one patient mustn'ttake more than 20 minutes;and, finally, the number ofprocessed calls during one shiftmust not be less than 20.These are old rules and theyare impossible to follow.Excreting urine in 20minutes is impossible.We'll make it possible.Emergency medicine implies aquick response and treatment.Anyone in need of help should receive it.But that's virtually impossible.There's no point in calling something "impossible".Anything is possible if you work hard.Okay, moving on...Next change: from nowon, you'll be requiredto report to a dispatcher during a call.To avoid any improvisation.Is that clear?A report right during a call?That's it. Right during a call.You'll have to keep a dispatcherinformed about any progress:applied medicine, its quantity,your next destination, and so on.And most importantly: you'll have to followa dispatcher's instructions no matter what.From now on, their instructionsare of utmost importance.Let them take the calls, then.Why would they need us?That's what they have been doingin Moscow for a long time...Alyosha, we are not in Moscow.Excuse me, you'll have a chance to discussthe way our Moscow colleagues work later.Let's move on. From now on, we'll havea distinct classification of teams.The dispatchers will makesure that certain teamstake care of certain patientsaccording to their qualification.Should I explain?If you could, it's not clear.Okay, what's the situation now?The closest team gets the call, right?As a result, resuscitatorstreat alcohol poisoning...pediatricians take care of some bums...and paramedics have todeal with gunshot wounds.As a result, numerous fatalities.That's unacceptable. From now on, eachteam is appointed to their specific cases.Is that clear, guys?What if I'm passing bysomeone else's patient?You ignore it and keepgoing to your patient.In other words, we don't give ashit about the patients, right?Listen, you'll be there first, butyou won't be able to help a patient.What's the point?In these cases, we normallycall for a second team.Which brings us to themost unpleasant part.The last rule of the downsizingplan goes as follows:one team cannot call fora second backup team.We'll have to make it work in orderto process as many calls as possible.What if it's a criticalor more than one patient?Drive them to the hospital, then.What about the downsizing you mentioned?It's coming, but that's not up to me.Okay, the meeting is over.Have a great shift!- Finally, we've been waiting for you.- Let's go.Oleg!- Come here.- Dima, what is it?Come here for a sec.We have to go to another patient.- What do you mean?- No idea, that's what I was told.Gimme that.Excuse us, we are not pediatricians.We were sent here by mistake.Is it about your child?- Yes, the child is feeling sick.- Pediatricians are on their way.We are outside the patient's apartment.That's not your patient.Go to Gavrilova Street.</i>What are you talking about?!The pediatricians weren'tavailable, now they are.</i>That's bullshit!- You bastards, we've been waiting for so long!- How can you treat people like that?!How can you leave a sick kid like that?!Dima, let's go.- Floor number?- Four.Oleg, we got another patient!- I don't give a shit.- That's more like it!When are you moving out?Are you even looking for an apartment?- Katya, why are you yelling?- I'm not yelling.I'm moving out tomorrow.Is that okay?You can move out when youhave a new place, okay?Get out of my room.Did she have breathingproblems in the past?We've been using the Ventolin spray.Did a doctor prescribe it?No, a woman in thedrugstore recommended it.Open the window.Nina, you should lie down.Let's leave the recommendations to me.Nina Petrovna, you should remainseated, put your hand on your knee.Dima, get the wet oxygen mask ready.- Could you get the cat out of here?- Sure.- I'll take her to another room.- You better lock her in the bathroom.Try to breathe smoothly.Oleg, she's getting worse.Prednisolone.Dima.Could you answer it?Yes?You should wrap up.We can't, we're not done yet.Report on the situation.- Marina, is that you?- <i>Yeah.</i>What are you talking about? What report?We're giving her shots,monitoring the condition.Oleg, you should already begoing to another patient.</i>Marina, you are impeding.- <i>You should've been done already.</i>- Marina, extend the call.Dexamethasone.Is she going to be all right?- You should get rid of the cat and all the carpets.- Okay.Wet cleaning twice a day.I'll contact your districtdoctor right now...- He'll come as soon as possible. Ask for a hospital referral.- Thank you.Nina Petrovna, look at me.That's better. There's the sparkle.You can't use Ventolin withoutdoctor's prescription.We've been using it every day.That's the result of Ventolin addiction. Itdoes not heal, it suppresses the symptoms.It doesn't make the illness go away.- Is that clear?- Yes.Nina Petrovna.That's it. That's better.Let's leave it on for a bit, shall we?That's the spirit.Marina, can you hear me?- <i>Yes.</i>- What's up?- <i>Thanks a lot, the other team didn't make it.</i>- What?- <i>You are the closest ones, go there.</i>- What's up?The patient died.Shit!- Hello.- Hello. Please come in.- Volodya, stop it!- You bastards!- My God!- Where is she?In the room back there.I need one of you to come with me.One of you. One person.Vera, you go. I can't take it.What took you so long?She might have been alive.- I'll need her documents.- It's all on the table.How old was she?She was 74.- Why did you call an ambulance?- She's been having a heartache all day.Did she have any chronic diseases?She had a cardiac defect from birth.Done with the examination?Can we take her away?- Sure. I'm getting the papers ready.- Should we dress her in something?A sweater or something?We'll cover the body. Got a sheet?Vera, go get dressed. Youshould come with her.You don't have to go anywhere.They'll contact you.You'll take the body when you'redone with funeral arrangements.Hey, Mr. Doctor.Tell me, is your mother alive?She is.You should pray to fucking God...that she doesn't getthis kind of treatment.- You killed my mother!- Volodya, calm down!Who gave you this right?!Bring her back!Let's go, man.Oleg!You scared me.What are you doing?I'm just... Grabbing my passport.Relax.- Where are you off to? You are working tomorrow.- I'm leaving already.I'm really sorry.Let's pretend I wasn't even here.Hey.Hi.Why aren't you coming up?Katya, I want you to listen to me.I'm just...I want you to just listen to what I haveto say. Don't get mad, just think it over.I'm not mad at you.Katya.Let's stop that.At least, for a couple of days.Let's stop torturing each other.Please.I can't...I can't take it.Can we do that?Can we...not make any seriousdecisions at the moment?Can we just take it easy and--I don't know.- Sleep it off.- That's it, sleep it off.Take a break from all this.Can we do that, Katya?We can.Thank you.Can I give you a hug?Just a hug.May we come in?Go ahead.Take your seats.Anton, could you grab a chairfrom the reception desk?I'm listening, colleagues.How can I help?- I'll start, maybe the guys will add something.- Okay, good.It's about the new rules that makeus work our asses off, pardon me.We know you didn't make them...They are part of thelong-running medical reform.- We know that.- What is it, then?We have to be reasonable about thoserules, and it's not even about the fines--Excuse me. It's about the fines, too.I haven't had a single fine since 2010.Got two in the last week.As I recall, those fines wereimposed by the insurance company.That's why those callswill not be paid for.- Why on earth not?- Vanya, let's not change the topic.The thing is...Let's take our patients.Each case is unique, wehave to remember that.That's why your 20-minute rules are faulty.They disregard the individualapproach to patients.- The human factor.- That's right.These rules were set a while ago.But nonetheless, our former bossunderstood everything and made it work.We can't always go by the book.You can't follow the rules at alltimes when it comes to saving lives.We used to do it our own way.Also, our dispatchers neverbugged us this much before.They are getting on our nerves.I'm busy, the paramedic is trying to work andshe's constantly yapping over the radio.We want things to be theway they used to be.We are no robots, we are human beings.Is that it?Okay.Listen.Everything you just said--You can't be serious.I'm really surprised that the humanfactor is put at the heart of the issue.I can show you what thehuman factor looks like.Here it is.A sloppy doctor.Took the liberty of ignoring thedispatcher's instructions...by taking out the radio's battery, sono one would "bug" him, as you put it.As a result, a person died.Because of the human factor.I couldn't have left the patient.I'll tell you what you should've done.Did you use Aminophylline?I did. But it doesn't work instantly.Listen to me. You injected it...Observed the patient's condition.If it started stabilizing,you should've called the district doctor and that'sit, that would've been his job from then on.Or you could've taken herto the hospital, if necessary.Instead, you spent over an hourtrying to cure all of her diseases.Meanwhile, another patient was dying.That's what your "human factor" leads to.Excuse me, that won't do.Let's look at it this way:had he listened to the dispatcherand abandoned the asthma patient,she could have died as well.I work on my particular calls, am I right?The only thing that matters is that thepatient doesn't die afterwards, right?Wrong.It matters that no one dieswhile you are treating them.Let them die when beingtreated by other doctors.Your goal it to take aliving person to hospital,or to their district doctor. They candie after that all they want.Okay, I got your point.- Did you call the cops?- We did.Back off, everyone!Dima, looks like a stabwound.Tell Nikolayevich to bring the stretcher.- Nikolayevich, get over here.- <i>Why?</i>- Multiple victims.- <i>Roger that.</i>Send a resuscitation team, ASAP.What's going on there?Looks like a mass murder.- Send them, quick!- <i>They are on a call.</i>- Send a second team, then!- <i>Oleg, that's against regulations.</i>Lyuba, what the hell?!There's a bunch of victims here!- <i>I'll see what I can do.
